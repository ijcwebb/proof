17.10 -  In a right angled triangle, the length of the hypotenuse is always less than the sum of the lengths of the two other sides.
Saera Turdieva
TRUE. Direct proof:
Let’s say that I am in a rectangle room and I have to hit the corner at the other end of the diagonal.
It is shorter for me to go straight to the other end diagonally than going up and turning right (or left).
In my example, diagonal means the hypotenuese of a right angled triangle, and “up” and “turn right” means sides of a triangle. Rectangle room divided by diagonal is a right angled triangle.
It intuitively proves that sum of lengths of two other sides is always greater than the length of the hypotenuse.
