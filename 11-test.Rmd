# Direct proof

Look back at the proof of **Conjecture 8.1** in Chapter 8. This was an example of a direct proof. Direct proofs use algebra to move from $P$ to $Q$. 

## Steps

-  If possible, rewrite the conjecture in the form **If ... then ...**.
-  If possible, draw the map of the statement. The map is not always essential (or even easy) to draw. However for some proofs it will be invaluable!
-  Define any variables that you use, for example "$m \in \mathbb Q$" or "$n \in \mathbb Z, n \neq 0$". 
-  If you are relying on any definitions or axioms (from our Miro board or elsewhere), you should explicitly reference them. You don't need to explain or prove them, but by not referencing axioms and definitions you employ, you might leave your audience in the dark.

## Formal definition

Simply, prove that "If $P$ then $Q$".

## Practice

Use these examples to practise. If it's not in the form **If ... then ...**, make sure you rewrite it before starting the proof. Attempt the proof before checking the solution.

(\#cnj:wave:) The sum of two even numbers is even.}

Rewritten conjecture : If $a$ and $b$ are even integers, then $a+b$  is even.

```{proof}
Since $a$ and $b$ are even, they can be written as
\begin{align}
    a &= 2k \\
    b &= 2l
\end{align}
where $k$ and $l$ are integers. Therefore the sum of $a$ and $b$ is
\begin{align}
    a + b &= 2k + 2l\\
    &= 2(k + l)
\end{align} 
by factoring out 2.

As the sum of integers equals an integer, $k + l$ must equal some integer. Let's call it $m$. Therefore we have
\begin{align}
    a + b &= 2m
\end{align}
which is clearly even.
```

(\#cnj:welcome:) The square of an odd number is also odd.}

Rewritten conjecture: If $a$ is an odd integer, then $a^2$ is odd.

```{proof}
If $a$ is an odd integer, it can be expressed as
\begin{align}
    a &= 2k + 1 (\#eq:bertie) 
\end{align}
where $k$ is an integer. Squaring our odd number, we get
\begin{align}
    a^2 &= (2k + 1)^2 (\#eq:betty) \\
    &= 4k^2 + 4k +1 (\#eq:bernie) \\
    &= 2(2k^2 + 2k) +1 (\#eq:bessie) 
\end{align}
As $2k^2$ is an integer and $2k$ is an integer, $2k^2 + 2k$ is an integer, which we'll call $l$. Therefore Equality  \@ref(eq:bessie)  becomes
\begin{align}
    a^2 &= 2l+1 (\#eq:bess) 
\end{align}
and $a^2$ is therefore odd.
```

(\#cnj:wood:) The sum of the first $n$ positive integers is $\frac{n}{2}(n+1)$.
