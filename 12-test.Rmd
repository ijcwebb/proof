# Direct proof

<div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert">
<strong>Note: You should be familiar with the flowchart of proof in Chapter 10 before reading this chapter.

</div>

Welcome to our second method of proving conjectures: **direct proof**. 

Direct proofs use algebra to move from $P$ to $Q$. 

## Steps

1. Make sure the conjecture is in the form **If ... then ...**. This is good practice for any method of proof, but especially direct proof. 

2. What do you know? What information does $P$ give you? What do you know about the subject of the conjecture?

3. How can what you know get you to the conclusion you need to make, $Q$? 

<div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert">
<strong>Be aware!
</strong> 

- You might have to try out different routes from $P$ until you find one that gets you to $Q$.

- It is wrong to use $Q$ in your proof. You of course should use it to guide your work, like a goal to reach, but $Q$ isn't a tool to be used in a direct proof. (See **Assuming the thing to be proved is true** in Chapter 9, section 4.)

## Formal definition

Simply, prove that "If $P$ then $Q$".

***Solutions:***

Conjecture \@ref(cnj:wave): First, we rewrite the conjecture,

<center> If $a$ and $b$ are even integers, then $a+b$ is even. </center>

Now we're ready for a direct proof.

```{proof}
Since $a$ and $b$ are even, they can be written as
\begin{align}
    a &= 2k \\
    b &= 2l
\end{align}
where $k$ and $l$ are integers. Therefore the sum of $a$ and $b$ is
\begin{align}
    a + b &= 2k + 2l\\
    &= 2(k + l)
\end{align} 
by factoring out 2.

As the sum of integers equals an integer, $k + l$ must equal some integer. Let's call it $m$. Therefore we have
\begin{align}
    a + b &= 2m
\end{align}
which is clearly even.
```

***

Conjecture \@ref(cnj:welcome): First, we rewrite the conjecture,

<center> If $a$ is an odd integer, then $a^2$ is odd. </center>

Now we're ready for a direct proof.

```{proof}
If $a$ is an odd integer, it can be expressed as
\begin{align}
    a &= 2k + 1 
\end{align}
where $k$ is an integer. Squaring our odd number, we get
\begin{align}
    a^2 &= (2k + 1)^2 \\
    &= 4k^2 + 4k +1  \\
    &= 2(2k^2 + 2k) +1 (\#eq:bessie) 
\end{align}
As $2k^2$ is an integer and $2k$ is an integer, $2k^2 + 2k$ is an integer, which we'll call $l$. Therefore Equality  \@ref(eq:bessie)  becomes
\begin{align}
    a^2 &= 2l+1  
\end{align}
and $a^2$ is therefore odd.
```

Conjecture \@ref(cnj:wood): See https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaFrAFZATKU.

***

Conjecture \@ref(cnj:weapon): First, we rewrite the conjecture,

<center> If four integers are consecutive, then the difference between the product of the </center>
<center> last two and the product of the first two of these numbers is equal to their sum. </center>

Now we're ready for a direct proof.

```{proof}
Four consecutive integers can be write as $a, a+1, a+2, a+3$.

Then the product of the first two will be

\begin{align}
    a(a+1) &= a^2 + a (\#eq:bernie)
\end{align}

and the product of the last two will be

\begin{align}
    (a+2)(a+3) &= a^2 + 5a + 6 (\#eq:betty)
\end{align}
    
The difference between Equality \@ref(eq:betty) and Equality \@ref(eq:bernie) is
\begin{align}
    (a^2 + 5a + 6) -  (a^2 + a) &= 4a + 6  (\#eq:bess)
\end{align} 

We need to show this Equality \@ref(eq:bess) is the same as the sum of the four numbers, which is

\begin{align}
    a + a+1 + a+2 + a+3 &= 4a + 6
\end{align}

As this is the same as Equality \@ref(eq:bess), we are done.

Some of these conjectures are false; disprove them by finding a **counterexample**. Some of them are true; prove them using a proof by **exhaustion** (from last class) or a **direct proof** (from this class).
