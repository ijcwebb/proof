# Proof by induction

One of the simplest, but most powerful techniques of proof is *Induction*. We use it to show that a conjecture is true for all integers above (and including) a specified integer. 

## The steps

There are two things to do:

**First**, *assume* that the conjecture is true for $a$ (or whatever is the subject of the conjecture), and show that the conjecture would also be correct for the next number $a + 1$.

**Second**, show that the conjecture is true for the lowest value of $a$, called $a_0$. This is known the 'base case'. 

And you're done!

## The domino analogy

Think of this method of proof like a row of dominoes, and you want every domino to fall over:

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="65%", fig.cap="A row of dominoes. Source: Pokipsy76 via commonswiki.", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics(rep("figures/dominoeffect.png"))
```

First, you make sure that each domino is spaced so that if the one before it falls, then it too will fall. This is proving that if the conjecture is true for $a$, it's also true for $a+1$. 

Next, you push the first domino. This is proving the conjecture is true for the base case, $a_0$. 

The result: all the dominoes will fall - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TE5RdFFgW0w.

## When to use induction

We usually use a proof by induction when the conjecture:

- is dealing with integers,
- has an obvious starting point, for example "for all positive integers...", "for all three-digit primes", "for all odd numbers", etc.

## Identifying the base case

It's easy to identify the base case $a = a_0$, as it will be obvious from the conjecture. For example, if the conjecture begins:

- "For all integers greater than or equal to 2 ...", then your base case is $a_0 = 2$. 
    
- "For all positive integers ...", your base case is  $a_0 = 1$. 
    
- "For all non-negative integers ...", your base case is $a_0 = 0$.
    
- "For all integers greater than $-10$ ...", your base case is  $a_0 = -9$.
    
- "For all composite numbers ...", your base case is  $a_0 = 4$.


## Formal definition

To prove $P \Rightarrow Q$ for all $a$ (where usually $a \in \mathbb Z$) by induction, show that

<center>

If $P \Rightarrow Q$ for $a$, then $P \Rightarrow Q$ for $a+1$

</center>

and

<center>

$P \Rightarrow Q$ for $a_0$,

</center>

where $a_0$ is the smallest example of $a$.

## Practice

As always, a method of proof is easier to understand when actually doing it. Use the examples below to get hands on with this method. As always, if the conjecture is not in the form **If ... then ...**, make sure you rewrite it before starting the proof.

```{example}
Consider the following conjecture:

(\#cnj:pack): The sum of the first $a$ positive integers is given by $\frac{a(a+1)}{2}$

```

```{proof}
Step 1: Show that if the conjecture is true for $a$, then it must be true for $a+1$.

We assume that the sum of the first $a$ positive integers is $\frac{a(a+1)}{2}$. The sum of the first $a+1$ positive integers would therefore be

\begin{align}
  \frac{(a+1)((a+1)+1)}{2}
\end{align}

which was found by replacing any appearance of $a$ with $a+1$. Let's simplify

\begin{align}
  \frac{(a+1)((a+1)+1)}{2} &= \frac{(a+1)(a+1+1)}{2} \\
  &= \frac{(a+1)(a+2)}{2} \\
  &= \frac{a^2+3a+2}{2}. (\#eq:pursuit)
\end{align}

But if the sum of the first $a$ positive integers is $\frac{a(a+1)}{2}$, then the sum of the first $a+1$ positive integers is $(a+1)$ more than $\frac{a(a+1)}{2}$, so

\begin{align}
  \frac{a(a+1)}{2} + (a+1). (\#eq:paper)
\end{align}

Let's simplify Equation \@ref(eq:paper) and check whether this is same as Equation \@ref(eq:pursuit).

\begin{align}
  \frac{a(a+1)}{2} + (a+1) &= \frac{a(a+1)}{2} + \frac{2(a+1)}{2} \\
  &= \frac{a(a+1) + 2(a+1)}{2} \\
  &= \frac{a^2+a + 2a+2}{2} \\
  &= \frac{a^2+3a+2}{2}
\end{align}

which is the same as we found in Equation \@ref(eq:pursuit). We have proved that if the conjecture is true for the first $a$ positive integers, it will be true for the first $a+1$ positive integers.

Step 2: We should show that the conjecture is true for the base case. For this conjecture, the base case is $a_0 = 1$, as we're concerned with the first $a$ positive integers and the first positive integer is 1.

The sum of the first 1 positive integers is 1. Let's substitute $a_0 = 1$ into $\frac{a(a+1)}{2}$ and check we get this:

\begin{align}
  \frac{a(a+1)}{2} &= \frac{1(1+1)}{2} \\
  &= \frac{2}{2} \\
  &= 1
\end{align}
    
We've shown the conjecture is true for the base case, $a=1$.

```

Because we've also shown that if the conjecture is true for $a$, it's true for $a+1$, we know the conjecture is true for $a=2$. And as the conjecture is true for $a=2$, it must be true for $a=3$. And as the conjecture is true for $a=3$, it must be true for $a=4$, and so on.

```{example}
Consider the following conjecture:

(\#cnj:progress): Every non-negative integer is either even or odd.

For this conjecture, we'll need a proof by induction *using cases*.

```

```{proof}
Step 1: Show that if the conjecture is true for $a$, then it must be true for $a+1$.

**Case 1:** Consider two consecutive numbers $x$ and $y$. If $x$ is even, it can be written as $2k$, where $k$ is some integer. As $y$ is consecutive to $x$, it must equal $2k + 1$, which means it is odd. We have shown that odd numbers always follow even numbers.

**Case 2:** Consider two consecutive numbers $x$ and $y$. If $x$ is odd, it can be written as $2k +1$, where $k$ is some integer. As $y$ is consecutive to $x$, it must equal $(2k + 1) + 1 = 2k + 2$ which can be written as $2(k + 1)$, which means it is even. We have shown that even numbers always follow odd numbers.

Step 2: We should show that the conjecture is true for the base case. As the conjecture concerns non-negative integers, our base case is $a_0 = 0$. 0 is even, because $0 = 2(0)$. We are done. \hspace{10mm}

```

Why are we done?? Because 0 is even, then 1 must be odd and because 1 is odd, 2 must be even, and so on, till infinity...

<strong>Note
</strong> We could use a similar proof to show this conjecture is also true till negative infinity. See the next section.

## Going the "other" way

The method of proof by induction I have so far described is built for proving all cases till *positive* infinity, from the base case upwards.

Quite easily, however, this method can be modified to prove all cases till *negative* infinity, from the base case **downwards**. 

For example, with Conjecture \@ref(cnj:progress) above, instead of showing that odd numbers always follow even numbers, you could show that even numbers always *precede* odd numbers (and that odd numbers always precede even numbers). Then, by using a base case of $a_0 = -1$, you could prove this conjecture for all negative integers till negative infinity. (See conjectures \@ref(cnj:prayer) and \@ref(cnj:pillow) below.)

```{exercise}
Try to prove the following conjectures using induction. I'm not promising that they're all true, but they *might* be. If a conjecture is not true, find a counterexample which disprove it.

(\#cnj:partner): The sum of two consecutive positive integers is odd. We have proved this theorem before, but try to prove it again using induction.
        
(\#cnj:peasant): The sum of the first $a$ positive odd numbers equals $a^2$.
        
(\#cnj:pumpkin): $2^a > a$ for all non-negative integers $a$.
        
(\#cnj:pain): $8^a - 1$ is divisible by 7 for any positive integer $a$.
        
(\#cnj:point): $8a - 1$ is divisible by 7 for any positive integer $a$.
        
(\#cnj:parade): Any group of students is able to be split up into groups of twos, groups of threes, or a combination of groups of twos and threes.
        
(\#cnj:pleasant): Any group of students greater than two is able to be split up into groups of threes, groups of fours, or a combination of groups of threes and fours.
        
(\#cnj:patch): Any amount greater than or equal to 12 soms can be made using an infinite supply of 4-som and 5-som coins.

```

```{exercise}
Use a proof by induction in the opposite direction (towards negative infinity) to prove:
  
(\#cnj:prayer): Every negative integer is either even or odd. (See Conjecture \@ref(cnj:progress) for the non-negative version of this.)
        
(\#cnj:pillow): $2^a > a$ for all negative integers $a$.

```

```{exercise}
Some of these conjectures are false; disprove them by finding a counterexample. Some of them are true; prove them using any of the methods we have so far covered.

(\#cnj:prey): The rows of Pascal's Triangle are all powers of 11.
  
(\#cnj:petty): The product of any amount of odd numbers is odd.
