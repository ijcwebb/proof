# Using previous proofs / disproofs

Noticing that a conjecture can be proved using previous work you've done can save you a lot of time! Aside from that, it can often show you the way that future conjectures can be proved.

Let's assume we have already proved the conjecture:

(\#cnj:collect): Every prime number, except 2 and 3, is either one more or one less than a multiple of 6.

Knowing this is true, we can use it in the proof of the conjecture:

(\#cnj:cusp): Doubling **every** prime number (except 2) then adding two creates a number divisible by four.

```{proof} 
As conjecture \@ref(cnj:collect) is known to be true, we know that every prime $p$, $p \neq 2, 3$, can be written in the form

\begin{align}
    p &= 6k + 1
\end{align}

or

\begin{align}
    p &= 6k - 1
\end{align}

with $k \in \mathbb Z$.

Let's deal with these one-by-one.

If

\begin{align}
    p &= 6k + 1
\end{align}

then doubling it and adding two gives

\begin{align}
    2p + 2  &= 2(6k + 1) + 2 \\
    &= 12p + 2 + 2 \\
    &= 12p + 4 \\
    &= 4(3p + 1)
\end{align}

which is a multiple of 4.

Similarly, if

\begin{align}
    p &= 6k - 1
\end{align}

then doubling it and adding two gives

\begin{align}
    2p + 2  &= 2(6k - 1) + 2 \\
    &= 12p - 2 + 2 \\
    &= 12p \\
    &= 4(3p)
\end{align}

which is a multiple of 4.

As noted in the first line of the proof, this proof covers all primes *except* $2$ and $3$. However, conjecture  \@ref(cnj:cusp) covers all primes except $2$, so we should also check that the conjecture holds for $3$. 

If $p=3$, then $2p+2 = 2 \cdot 3 + 2 = 6 + 2 = 8$, which is a multiple of $4$. 

Therefore the conjecture is true.

The following conjectures *might* need you to use earlier work, or might not.
  
Every prime number, except $2$ and $3$, is either one more or one less than a multiple of $6$. (This is the conjecture on the previous page!) 
Hint: You might want to try writing the positive whole numbers greater than $3$ in a rectangular grid, in such a way that all the primes are in only one or two columns.

Doubling **every** prime number (except $2$) then adding two creates a number divisible by four. (We proved this on the previous page!)

Squares of odd numbers are all one more than a multiple of $8$.

The only numbers which can be classed as "odd" or "even" are integers (whole numbers).

$a^2 - a + 41$ is always prime for all positive integers $a$.

$a^2 - a + 41$ is always prime for all **nonpositive} integers $a$.

The **interior angles** of the octagon formed by joining the midpoint of each side of a square with each corner of the square are not all equal. *Hint: Draw the picture first!*

$1^2$, $11^2$, $111^2$, $1111^2$, ... are all palindromic numbers.

A palindromic number is one that reads the same backwards as it does forwards, e.g. $987789$ and $62926$.
Similarly, a word is palindromic if it reads the same backwards as it does forwards, e.g. *racecar* and *noon*. Sentences can be palindromic too, usually by ignoring spaces and punctuation, e.g. "*No lemon, no melon*" or "*Was it a cat I saw?*".

Something slightly different today:
  
This chapter was all about using previously proved (or disproved) conjectures to aid your work on new proofs. Today, I want you to look back over *all* the previous conjectures we've proved and disproved and use your findings to write some new conjectures.

Here are the rules:

Each student should write at least two conjectures. 
    
- The conjectures should be true.
    
- The conjectures should be provable using work which you and your classmates have previously done, and using the methods we've already met: direct proof and exhaustion.
    
- DON'T rush - take your time to write these conjectures.
    
- Post your conjectures onto the XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXx padlet.
**Note:** Post each conjecture whenever it's ready to go!
    
- If you still have time remaining in class OR as homework, try to solve some of your classmates' conjectures. Post your proof **underneath** their post.
**Note:** DON'T solve too many conjectures - leave some for other people to solve!!
    
- If there are no unsolved conjectures left on the padlet, try solving one of the conjectures already solved. Maybe you can solve it in a different way??
    
- If you think your classmate has written a conjecture which is actually false, tell them by posting a disproof (or counterexample) under their post.
    
- If *your* conjecture is disproved by a classmate, can you modify it to make it true?

Good luck!
