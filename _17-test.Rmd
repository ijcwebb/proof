    \textbf{What?}
    \\To prove that P $ \Rightarrow $ only Q, prove  that T $ \Rightarrow $ only S.
    \vspace{5mm}\\
    \textbf{Steps for a proof by contrapositive:}
    \\\underline{Step 1:} Identify P and Q (and then S and T).
    \\\underline{Step 2:} Build the map of the conjecture.
    \\\underline{Step 3:} Prove T only $ \Rightarrow $ S. If this is true, then P only $ \Rightarrow $ Q, и все!

    \\\textbf{Why would you use this method?}
    \\For example, if a direct proof requires lots of cases, proving the contrapositive might require no cases (or fewer cases), so it can save you time.

\textbf{Proof by contra-position:} Assume $\neg Q$ and aim for $\neg P$
\\If $Q$ hasn't happened, you know $P$ has not happened, or in other words, $Q$ cannot happen without $P$. If $Q$ cannot happen without $P$, then 
\end{tcolorbox}
For contra-position, these two methods are basically the same: if you are able to prove $\neg P$ from $\neg Q$ (the method of contra-position) then because proof by contradiction requires you to assume $P$ then  then that would also yield a contradiction in the proof by contradiction, since you are assuming $P$.
\\So you might as well do a proof by contradiction if you are going to do a proof by contrapositive! 
In fact, this is actually how many proofs by contrapositive are found: begin with a proof by contradiction, and then after you are done you realise you never use the assumption of $P$, so the proof is rewritten.
