# Axioms and definitions

Now that we fully understand what makes a statement "mathematical", we should discuss **axioms** and **definitions**. 

## Axioms are a special kind of mathematical statement

Axioms are mathematical statements which are true, and are *self-evidently* so and therefore cannot be proved. They should be things so obviously true or so universally accepted, that when you read them, you say to yourself, "*Duh, of course!*"^[https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/duh]. Axioms should be so obvious, that when asked to prove them, you end up scratching your head and shouting "C'MON, IT JUST *IS* TRUE!!!!".

Axioms are the building blocks of mathematics. There is no complete list of them all, as we can always add more of them to the list. This chapter contains the axioms which we may use in this course. Tell me if you find a statement which you believe is an axiom but which I've forgotten, and I'll add it to the list below.

### Rules of axioms

- Axioms describe a property of a mathematical object or operation.
- Axioms should never cover more than one property.
- The property each axiom describes is not necessarily unique to the mathematical object, for example the *commutativity* property is true for both multiplication, "$ab = ba$", and addition, "$a+b=b+a$". Similarly "There are infinitely many ways to cut a circle into two equal halves" is also true for spheres: "There are infinitely many ways to cut a spheres into two equal halves".
- Axioms are mathematical statements which are true, elementary and universally accepted, but which don't have proofs (because they are so fundamental).
- Axioms should not be derived from other axioms.

### Axioms about algebra

Here are a few axioms about algebra. Note that $a, b, c$ and $d$ can be *any* numbers.^[See https://www.aaamath.com/ac11.htm.]

- If $a = c$ then $c = a$.
- If $a = c$ and $b = c$, then $a = b$.
- If $a = b$ and $b = c$, then $a = c$.
- If $a = b$ and $c = d$, then $a + c = b + d$.
- $a \cdot b = b \cdot a$.
- If $a = b$ and $c = d$, then $ac = bd$.

### Axioms about geometry

Here are a few axioms about geometry.^[See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations_of_geometry, http://web.mit.edu/wwmath/vectorc/3d/old/axioms.html, https://www.ams.org/journals/tran/1904-005-03/S0002-9947-1904-1500678-X/S0002-9947-1904-1500678-X.pdf, and http://www.mrc.uidaho.edu/~rwells/Critical%20Philosophy%20and%20Mind/Chapter%2023.pdf.] Look up any words you don't understand.

- If you have two points, you can draw a straight line which connects them.
- If you have two points, you can always draw a circle with one of the points at the circle's centre and the other on its edge.
- There are infinitely many ways to cut a circle into two equal halves.
- A straight line can be extended in either direction forever.
- Three points can be arranged in such a way that they don't all lie on the same straight line.
- Four points can be arranged in such a way that they don't all lie on the same flat plane.

**Note:** All of these axioms above can be written in even briefer terms, though I haven't done so, in order to ensure clarity.

```  
</div>

<div class="alert alert-danger" role="alert">
```{exercise}
Can you think of any more algebraic or geometric statements which you believe are *so* obviously true that they are in fact axioms. Suggest them to me and if they're axioms, I'll add them to this chapter.

It's possible that *you* might consider a statement to be an axiom (something so obviously true that no proof is needed), but someone else might believe it is not self-evident and that a proof is needed. 

That's fine...if challenged to prove something that you believe is an axiom, rise to that challenge!

```  
</div>

## Definitions are a special kind of axiom

Where axioms describe a property of a mathematical object or operation, **definitions** describe mathematical objects or operations themselves. If axioms form the *rulebook* of mathematics, then definitions form the *dictionary* of mathematics.

### Rules of definitions

- Definitions describe a mathematical object or operation.
- Definitions should never cover more than one object or operation.
- Mathematical objects or operations don't have to have just one possible definition (e.g. the meaning of multiplication changes if we're talking about scalars, vectors, matrices, etc.).
- Definitions answer the question, "What is a ...?", for example "What is a square" or "What is an even number?" or "What is multiplication?"
- Definitions can't be proved, they are just accepted by all people doing mathematics.
- Definitions allow us to all agree on key terms in mathematics.
- Definitions can refer to other definitions.

<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
```{exercise}
Write definitions for the following objects or operations.

a. A **square number** (or **perfect square**).
b. A **whole number** (or **integer**).
c. A **non-whole number**.
d. **Consecutive** whole numbers.
e. One number **divides** another. (Careful here, I don't simply mean division. Consider that 4 *divides* 12 but that 5 *does not divide* 12.)
f. An **even number**.
g. An **odd number**.
h. The **absolute** (or **modulus**) operation.
i. A **point**.
j. A **line**.

```
</div>

```{solution}
These are *my* definitions, but these are not perfect. Different people might choose different words to describe these things, and your definitions might look different to mine. This isn't a problem as long as our definitions are both clear, and we both mean the same thing!

a. A **square number** (or **perfect square**) is the square of a whole number.
b. **Whole numbers** (or **integers**) are numbers with digits only to the left of the decimal point.
c. **Non-whole numbers** are numbers which have value to the right of the decimal point (and possibly to the left too).
d. Two whole numbers $a$ and $b$ are **consecutive** if either $b = a + 1$ or $a = b + 1$.
e. $a$ **divides** $b$ if $b \div a$ leaves no remainder.
f. **Even numbers** are whole numbers which can be written in the form $2n$, where $n$ is a whole number.
g. **Odd numbers** are whole numbers which *cannot* be written in the form $2n$, where $n$ is a whole number.^[Alternatively: **Odd numbers** are whole numbers which can be written in the form $2n + 1$, where $n$ is a whole number.]
h. The **absolute** (or **modulus**) of a negative number is the positive version of that number.
i. A **point** has no length, width or height.
j. A **line** has length but no width or height.

<strong> What have we learnt? </strong> 

- Axioms are special kinds of mathematical statements; they are ones which are self-evidently true. They are the building blocks of mathematics.
    
- We've also learnt that *really* fundamental axioms are called definitions. They are how we guarantee that you, your fellow mathematicians and your reader all understand what you're talking about!^[See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuous_truth.]

## Types of real numbers

In the following exercise, we will encounter some axioms about **inequalities**. Inequalities describe the ordering of real numbers. Let's first check we know what real numbers are.

Real numbers are any numbers on the number line which stretches from $-\infty$ to $\infty$.

Any number that a calculator can display is a real number!

Real numbers are:

- Whole numbers (integers)
- Terminating decimals (0.1, -0.5, 68.25)
- Recurring decimals ($\frac{1}{3} = 0.3333...$, $-\frac{11}{9} = -1.2222...$, $\frac{1}{7} = 0.142857142857...$)
- Non-recurring decimals ($\pi = 3.1415926...,$ $e = 2.7182818284590$, $\sqrt{2} = 1.41421356237...$)

There are two types of real number:
- *Rational numbers} can be expressed as the ratio of two whole numbers.
For example: $\frac{1}{2}, -\frac{3}{4}$ (or $\frac{-3}{4}), \frac{11}{3}$, 4 (or $\frac{4}{1}$), -7 (or $\frac{-7}{1}$), 0 (or $\frac{0}{1}$), 1 (or $\frac{1}{1}$).
- *Irrational numbers} can't be written as the ratio of two whole numbers.
For example: $\pi, e, \sqrt{2}, \sqrt{3}$.

<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
```{exercise}
Here are two axioms about inequalities:

a. If $a>0$ and $b>0$, then $a+b>0$.
b. If $a>0$ and $b>0$, then $ab>0$.
c. (If $a>0$ and $b>0$, then $a + b > a$ and $a + b > b$.)

``` 

```{exercise}
Because these are axioms, we can't prove them (they are *too* fundamental). However, we can illustrate them with examples. Find examples of each of the two axioms above, to illustrate them.

``` 

```{exercise}
Below are five more axioms about inequalities. Again, illustrate each of these axioms with an example.
    
- If $a > b$ and $k$ is any real number, then $a + k > b + k$.
- If $a > b$ and $b > c$, then $a > c$.
- If $a > b$ and $k > 0$ then $ak > bk$.
- If $a > b$ and $k < 0$, then  $ak < bk$.
- For any real number $a$, $a^2 \geq 0$.   

``` 

```{exercise}
Below are four conjectures about inequalities. Find *counterexamples* which disprove them:
    
- If $a>0$ and $b>0$, then $ab > a$ and $ab > b$.
- If $a^2 < b^2$ then $a < b$.
- If $a < b$ and $k < l$ then $ak < bl$.
- If $\dfrac{a}{b} > cd$ then $ad > bc$. 

You only need to find one counterexample for each.

*Hint: Negative numbers will be useful here!*
``` 
</div>

Before we move on, let's review types of numbers. We divide real numbers (symbol $\mathbb{R}$) in two groups:

- Integers, terminating decimals and recurring decimals are called rationals (symbol $\mathbb{Q}$), because they can all be expressed as the **ratio** of two integers. 
- Non-recurring decimals can't be expressed at the ratio of two integers and are therefore called irrationals (symbol $\mathbb{Q}'$).

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="80%", fig.cap="Types of numbers.", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics(rep("figures/numbertypes.png"))
```

How to use these symbols? To tell your reader that you're talking about a general real number, you write $a \in \mathbb{R}$, where $\in$ means "belongs to" or "is". If a conjecture doesn't mention what type of number it's talking about, assume it's dealing with all the real numbers.^[There are some numbers which are not real (called *complex numbers*). Although we will only be dealing with real numbers in this course, we state $a \in \mathbb{R}$ to avoid confusion.]

If you are specifically dealing with the integers, you can specify this by saying $a \in \mathbb{Z}$.

If you're dealing with *all* the rational numbers, you write $a \in \mathbb{Q}$. And if you're dealing with just irrational numbers, write $a \in \mathbb{Q}'$.^[Rational and irrational numbers have very different properties. The digits of rational numbers (including non-terminating decimal numbers) are fully known. The digits of irrational numbers can't be fully known because they follow no pattern and don't repeat. Just because you know the first 12 million decimal digits of $\pi$, it doesn't mean you can predict the 12-million-and-first digit!] ^[Whilst $\pi$ and $e$ are both known to be irrational, no one knows if $\pi + e$, $\pi e$, $\dfrac{\pi}{e}$, $\pi^e$, $\pi^\pi$, $e^e$, $e^\pi$, $2^e$ or ln$\pi$ are rational or irrational. See https://math.ou.edu/\char`\~jalbert/courses/openprob2.pdf.]


Finally, add $^{+}$ to any symbol to specify you're only talking about the positive numbers from the set. Similarly, add $^{-}$ to specify you're only talking about the negative numbers from the set.

```{exercise}

d. $a \in \mathbb{Z}^{*}$
e. $a \in \mathbb{Z}^{-}$

Within the integers, there are lots of sets of special numbers, for example **even numbers**, **odd numbers**, **prime numbers**, **triangle numbers**, **Fibonacci numbers**, and **perfect numbers**. Some of these sets overlap.

And within these sets, there are even smaller subsets of numbers. For example, the Mersenne primes are special examples of primes.
