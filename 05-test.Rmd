# Axioms and definitions

Now that we fully understand what makes a statement "mathematical", we should discuss **axioms** and **definitions**. 

## Axioms are a special kind of mathematical statement

Axioms are mathematical statements which are true, and are *self-evidently* so and therefore cannot be proved. They should be things so obviously true or so universally accepted, that when you read them, you say to yourself, "*Duh, of course!*"^[https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/duh]. Axioms should be so obvious, that when asked to prove them, you end up scratching your head and shouting "C'MON, IT JUST *IS* TRUE!!!!".

Axioms are the building blocks of mathematics. There is no complete list of them all, as we can always add more of them to the list. This chapter contains the axioms which we may use in this course. Tell me if you find a statement which you believe is an axiom but which I've forgotten, and I'll add it to the list below.

### Rules of axioms

- Axioms describe a property of a mathematical object or operation.
- Axioms should never cover more than one property.
- The property each axiom describes is not necessarily unique to the mathematical object, for example the *commutativity* property is true for both multiplication, "$ab = ba$", and addition, "$a+b=b+a$". Similarly "There are infinitely many ways to cut a circle into two equal halves" is also true for spheres: "There are infinitely many ways to cut a spheres into two equal halves".
- Axioms are mathematical statements which are true, elementary and universally accepted, but which don't have proofs (because they are so fundamental).
- Axioms should not be derived from other axioms.

### Axioms about algebra

Here are a few axioms about algebra. Note that $a, b, c$ and $d$ can be *any* numbers.^[See https://www.aaamath.com/ac11.htm.]

- If $a = c$ then $c = a$.
- If $a = c$ and $b = c$, then $a = b$.
- If $a = b$ and $b = c$, then $a = c$.
- If $a = b$ and $c = d$, then $a + c = b + d$.
- $a \cdot b = b \cdot a$.
- If $a = b$ and $c = d$, then $ac = bd$.

### Axioms about geometry

Here are a few axioms about geometry.^[See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations_of_geometry, http://web.mit.edu/wwmath/vectorc/3d/old/axioms.html, https://www.ams.org/journals/tran/1904-005-03/S0002-9947-1904-1500678-X/S0002-9947-1904-1500678-X.pdf, and http://www.mrc.uidaho.edu/~rwells/Critical%20Philosophy%20and%20Mind/Chapter%2023.pdf.] Look up any words you don't understand.

- If you have two points, you can draw a straight line which connects them.
- If you have two points, you can always draw a circle with one of the points at the circle's centre and the other on its edge.
- There are infinitely many ways to cut a circle into two equal halves.
- A straight line can be extended in either direction forever.
- Three points can be arranged in such a way that they don't all lie on the same straight line.
- Four points can be arranged in such a way that they don't all lie on the same flat plane.

**Note:** All of these axioms above can be written in even briefer terms, though I haven't done so, in order to ensure clarity. 

<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
```{exercise}

<div class="alert alert-danger" role="alert">
```{exercise}
Can you think of any more algebraic or geometric statements which you believe are *so* obviously true that they are in fact axioms. Suggest them to me and if they're axioms, I'll add them to this chapter.

It's possible that *you* might consider a statement to be an axiom (something so obviously true that no proof is needed), but someone else might believe it is not self-evident and that a proof is needed. 

That's fine...if challenged to prove something that you believe is an axiom, rise to that challenge!

```  
</div>

## Definitions are a special kind of axiom

Where axioms describe a property of a mathematical object or operation, **definitions** describe mathematical objects or operations themselves. If axioms form the *rulebook* of mathematics, then definitions form the *dictionary* of mathematics.

### Rules of definitions

- Definitions describe a mathematical object or operation.
- Definitions should never cover more than one object or operation.
- Mathematical objects or operations don't have to have just one possible definition (e.g. the meaning of multiplication changes if we're talking about scalars, vectors, matrices, etc.).
- Definitions answer the question, "What is a ...?", for example "What is a square" or "What is an even number?" or "What is multiplication?"
- Definitions can't be proved, they are just accepted by all people doing mathematics.
- Definitions allow us to all agree on key terms in mathematics.
- Definitions can refer to other definitions.

<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">

<strong> What have we learnt? </strong> 

- Axioms are special kinds of mathematical statements; they are ones which are self-evidently true. They are the building blocks of mathematics.
    
- We've also learnt that *really* fundamental axioms are called definitions. They are how we guarantee that you, your fellow mathematicians and your reader all understand what you're talking about!^[See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuous_truth.]

## Types of real numbers

In section 5.4, we will meet some axioms about **inequalities**. Inequalities describe the *ordering of real numbers*. In this section, we will check we know what real numbers are.

Real numbers are any numbers on the number line which stretches from $-\infty$ to $\infty$:

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="90%", fig.cap="The number line.", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics(rep("figures/numberline.png"))
```

\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}
\draw[latex-latex] (-5.5,0) -- (5.5,0) ; %edit here for the axis
\foreach \x in  {-5,-4, -3,-2,-1,0,1,2,3,4,5} % edit here for the vertical lines
\draw[shift={(\x,0)},color=black] (0pt,3pt) -- (0pt,-3pt);
\foreach \x in {,, -3,-2,-1,0,1,2,3,,} % edit here for the numbers
\draw[shift={(\x,0)},color=black] (0pt,0pt) -- (0pt,-3pt) node[below] 
{$\x$};
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

*Any* number that a calculator can display is a real number:

(A) Whole numbers (integers)
(B) *Terminating* decimals (0.1, -0.5, 68.25)
(C) *Recurring* decimals ($\frac{1}{3} = 0.3333...$, $-\frac{11}{9} = -1.2222...$, $\frac{1}{7} = 0.142857142857...$. In the last example, notice that the sequence $142857$ repeats.)
(D) Non-recurring decimals ($\pi = 3.1415926...,$ $e = 2.7182818284590$, $\sqrt{2} = 1.41421356237...$)

We split the four types of real number above into two groups: 

### Rational real numbers
(A), (B) and (C) are **rational real numbers**, because they can be expressed as the *ratio* of two integers.

<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
```{exercise}
Pick an example of a number of type (A), (B) and (C) above. Show for each of your choices that the number can be written as the ratio of two integers.

```
</div>

```{solution}
Answers will vary. An example of type (A) is $4$, which can be written as $\frac{4}{1}$, which is the ratio of two integers. Similarly, $-3$ can be written as $\frac{-3}{1}$, which is the ratio of two integers. An example of type (B) is $0.5$, which can be written as $\frac{1}{2}, which is the ratio of two integers. Similarly, $-0.1$ can be written as $\frac{-1}{10}$, which is the ratio of two integers. Or $1.875$, which can be written as $\frac{15}{8}$, and $19.5$ which can be written as $\frac{29}{2}$. An example of type (C) is $-0.1111...$ which can be written as $\frac{-1}{9}$, or 1.166666... which can be written as $\frac{7}{6}$.
```

### Irrational real numbers

Type (D) are **irrational real numbers**, because they *can't* be written as the ratio of two whole numbers.

<div class="alert alert-danger" role="alert">
```{exercise}
Later in the course, we'll see why $\pi$, $e$, $\sqrt{2}$ and $\sqrt{3}$ are all irrational numbers. Do you know a way to show this?^[Rational and irrational numbers have very different properties. The digits of rational numbers (including non-terminating decimal numbers) are fully known. The digits of irrational numbers can't be fully known because they follow no pattern and don't repeat. Just because you know the first 12 million decimal digits of $\pi$, it doesn't mean you can predict the 12-million-and-first digit!] ^[Whilst $\pi$ and $e$ are both known to be irrational, no one knows if $\pi + e$, $\pi e$, $\dfrac{\pi}{e}$, $\pi^e$, $\pi^\pi$, $e^e$, $e^\pi$, $2^e$ or ln$\pi$ are rational or irrational. See https://math.ou.edu/\char`\~jalbert/courses/openprob2.pdf.]

```
</div>

### Symbols

We use the symbol $\mathbb{R}$ to mean ALL real numbers, for example $a \in \mathbb{R}$ means that the number $a$ is a real number (and $a \not\in \mathbb{R}$ means that the number $a$ is not a real number^[We won't deal with "non-real" numbers (called imaginary or complex numbers) in this course.]).

We use the symbol $\mathbb{Q}$ for just the rational real numbers, and $\mathbb{Q}'$ for the non-rational real numbers. For those rational numbers which are integers (whole numbers), we use the symbol $\mathbb{Z}$.

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="90%", fig.cap="The real numbers are divided into two groups.", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics(rep("figures/numbertypes.png"))
```

How to use these symbols? As mentioned above, to tell your reader that you're talking about a general real number, you write $a \in \mathbb{R}$, where $\in$ means "belongs to" or "is".

<div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert">
<strong>Careful!</strong> 

The symbol $\in$ is very powerful: it covers ALL possible values of the type of number given. For example, if you write $a \in \mathbb{Z}$, you are saying that $a$ could be *any* integer in the world, and if you write $a \in \mathbb{Q}$, you're saying that $a$ can be *any* rational number. Similarly, writing $a \in \mathbb{Q'}$ means that $a$ is *any* irrational number (so not just $\pi$ or $\sqrt{2}$). 

</div>


Add $^{+}$ to any symbol to specify you're only talking about the positive numbers from the set. Similarly, add $^{-}$ to specify you're only talking about the negative numbers from the set.

<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
```{exercise}
Give a couple of examples of $a$ in each of the cases below.

a. $a \in \mathbb{Z}^{+}$
b. $a \in \mathbb{Q}'$
c. $a \in \mathbb{Q}^{+}$
d. $a \in \mathbb{Z}^{*}$
e. $a \in \mathbb{Z}^{-}$
f. $a \in \mathbb{R}$
g. $a \in \mathbb{C}$
h. $a \in \mathbb{Z}$
i. $a \in \mathbb{R}^{+}$

Part d might be more challenging!

``` 
</div>

### Further dividing up the integers

Within the integers, there are lots of sets of special numbers, for example *even* numbers, *odd* numbers, *prime* numbers, *triangle* numbers, *Fibonacci* numbers, and *perfect* numbers. Some of these sets overlap (i.e. there are some numbers which are in more than one set).^[Within these sets, there are even smaller subsets of numbers. For example, the Mersenne primes are special examples of primes.]

<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
```{exercise}
Can you find:

a. A number which is both prime *and* triangular?
b. A number which is both prime *and* perfect?
c. A number which is both triangular *and* perfect?

```

```{exercise}
Are there any prime Fibonacci numbers?

```

```{exercise}
 

a. Is 1 perfect? Triangular? Prime? A Fibonacci number?
b. Is 2 perfect? Triangular? Prime? A Fibonacci number?

``` 

```{exercise}
What's the smallest positive integer that is neither prime nor triangular nor perfect nor Fibonacci? 

``` 
</div>

## Inequalities

Inequalities compare numbers^[Or expressions], in terms of their size. Earlier in this chapter we defined "greater than" and "less than". One number is "greater than" another if it appears further to the right on the number line:

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="90%", fig.cap="The number line. The further to the right a number is, the 'greater' it is.", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics(rep("figures/numberline.png"))
```

So $11$ is greater than $10$ (or $11 > 10$), and $10$ is greater than $0$ (or $10 > 0$), and $2 > -5$ and $-5 > -10$. If we write $a > 5$, we mean that $a$ is a number greater than $5$ (for example $6$ or $20$ or $5.1$). If we write $a \geq 5$ we mean $a$ is either greater than $5$ or equal to $5$. The symbols $<$ and $\leq$ apply for less than, and less than or equal to.

<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
```{exercise}
Here are three axioms about inequalities:

a. If $a>0$ and $b>0$, then $a+b>0$.
b. If $a>0$ and $b>0$, then $ab>0$.
c. If $a>0$ and $b>0$, then $a + b > a$ and $a + b > b$.

Because these are axioms, we can't prove them (they are *too* fundamental). However, we can illustrate them with examples. Find examples of each of the axioms above, in order to illustrate them.

``` 
</div>

<div class="alert alert-danger" role="alert">
```{exercise}
Aida says that, mathematically, $-10$ is greater than $-50$. Murat says that $-50$ *could* be considered as greater than $-10$, in certain circumstances. How could you argue Murat's case? Give specific example(s) how he could be seen as right. ^[Note, in this course, we will ALWAYS use "greater than" to mean "further to the right on the number line" (despite what Murat says!).]

``` 
</div>

<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
```{exercise}
Below are five more axioms about inequalities. Again, illustrate each of these axioms with an example.
    
- If $a > b$ and $k$ is any real number, then $a + k > b + k$.
- If $a > b$ and $b > c$, then $a > c$.
- If $a > b$ and $k > 0$ then $ak > bk$.
- If $a > b$ and $k < 0$, then  $ak < bk$.
- For any real number $a$, $a^2 \geq 0$.   

``` 

```{exercise}
Below are four conjectures about inequalities. Find *counterexamples* which disprove them:
    
- If $a>0$ and $b>0$, then $ab > a$ and $ab > b$.
- If $a^2 < b^2$ then $a < b$.
- If $a < b$ and $k < l$ then $ak < bl$.
- If $\dfrac{a}{b} > cd$ then $ad > bc$. 

You only need to find one counterexample for each. *Hint: Negative numbers will be useful here!*
