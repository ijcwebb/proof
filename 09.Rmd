# Before we start...

Prior to beginning to prove some conjectures, there are several questions which students always have, or difficulties that seem to arise. This chapter will address some of them.

<!-- From Sheffield -->
<!-- ## Why prove something? -->

<!-- We should ask ourselves why we should care about mathematical proof. (Hopefully you asked yourself this prior to taking this course!) Why are mathematics proofs important? This is a *big* question, which we won't pretend to be able to answer in just a few short paragraphs, but I'll mention a couple of my main reasons for caring about mathematical proof: -->

<!-- - A proof of a mathematical statement is absolute; there is no exception to the rule. They cannot be argued this way or that way, and no two people can come to different conclusions upon reading a mathematical proof. There is no "fake news", "alternative facts", or lies in mathematics. Such absolute statements are wonderful and do not exist in any other field of study. As the mathematician Simon Singh wrote: “The search for a mathematical proof is the search for a knowledge which is more absolute than the knowledge accumulated by any other discipline”. -->

<!-- - Mathematics is EVERYWHERE! From music to the economy, from demographics to nature, from business to space travel, mathematics is used to help us reason about the world we live in. If we weren't able to apply mathematical theorems that we have proved to be true, we would not know much about the world around us. -->

<!-- - It is possible to know when you can not do better; for example, a cartographer wishing to use as few colours as possible to colour her maps can be told by a mathematician that four different colours will suffice to ensure no two adjacent areas are the same colour (this theorem is called the *Four Colour Theorem*}. Similarly mathematicians have been able to tell chemists when certain crystal structures have no mathematical obstructions (which led chemists to search for, and successfully produce, new crystal structures). There are numerous other examples of this kind. -->

<!-- - Mathematics isn't done simply to serve a purpose, however, or to support other fields. A mathematical proof precisely captures an idea, ideas which as well as being fundamental are often beautiful and elegant. These beautiful ideas deserve to be written down correctly. -->

## How do I write a good proof?

Here are some things to remember when writing proofs:

<!-- From Sheffield -->
<!-- - Always use English (or Kyrgyz, Spanish, Russian, Arabic or whichever language you're writing your proof in) to clearly convey what you mean; good mathematical arguments should read like an essay. Whenever you write a proof, you should read through your answer and check to see if it could be read aloud and still be understood.  -->

- Label lines of work that you need to refer back to with reference numbers. In this course, you should also label the conjecture with the reference number from the textbook. End the proof with the $\square$ symbol to show you're done.

<!-- From Sheffield -->
<!-- - Always clearly state your assumptions. This becomes extra important with the method proof by contradiction, and is key with the method proof by cases. -->

<!-- - Use words or symbols to correctly connect the mathematical statements which make up your proof (See the section below on the difference between the symbols $=$, $\Rightarrow$ and $\Leftrightarrow$.) -->

<!-- - Take pride in the mathematics you write; when you write a piece of mathematics, you are showing people *exactly* how you think. So, you should try to write as elegantly and beautifully as you can! -->

- Good mathematical proofs written by one person should be understandable by another. All terms should be clearly defined, and any variables used too.

- Proofs should be watertight, meaning that it shouldn't contain any holes - no one should be able to criticise you for not considering something. For example, if the conjecture concerns all whole numbers, your proof would not be valid if it only covers positive numbers. If the statement concerns all polygons, your proof would not be valid if it only covers triangles and squares.

- Proofs should always be as short and efficient as possible, whilst still being complete.

## How do I check my proof is correct?

Mathematicians can't check their own proofs, mainly because *they* wrote it. Have you ever tried to spot a mistake you've made in your own work? It can be really difficult to do! 

For a proof to be declared valid, it should be shared with your peers to check it. Germain did this, Mirzakhani did this, Euclid did this. In this course, you'll share your answers with me and with each other. 

Once your peers have approved it, you then can publish your proof as a piece of mathematics. It's at *this* point that you enter the history books and your mathematical proof remains valid for ever!

**Note:** As you move through the rest of this course, you will start to get a sense of when you have finished a proof. Knowing when a proof is finished, and when it is *not* finished, is a valuable skill you will develop.

## Key things to bear in mind when proving

**You can't prove a conjecture using examples** unless you can be sure that the examples cover all possible instances of the conjecture. Even if the conjecture holds for the first few examples you try, this is no guarantee that the conjecture is always true. Let's look at a couple of examples.

(\#cnj:hot): If $a$ is a prime number then so is $2^a - 1$. 

Whilst this conjecture holds for $a=2$, $a=3$, $a=5$, $a=7$ (the first four primes), the conjecture breaks at $a = 11$, because $a^{11} - 1 = 2047$ which isn't prime (it's divisible by both $23$ and $89$). 

(\#cnj:cold): $a^2 - a + 11$ is prime, for $a \in \mathbb Z^+$ 

holds for all values of $a$ from $1$ to $10$ but breaks at $a= 11$.

**You must define any variables you introduce.** For example, if you are told that $a$ is odd and you decide to express it as $a = 2k + 1$, you should tell your reader what $k$ is (in this case, $k$ is an integer). 

**Don't assume the thing to be proved is true.** If you are trying to prove something is true, you can't assume it is true at the beginning of the proof. The reason for this is because assuming it true at the beginning might encourage you to use it as an established fact during your proof.^[A lawyer in court trying to prove a defendant guilty is not allowed to say, "Because we know the defendant is guilty, we know he can't have been where he says he was on the night of the crime. Because we know he is guilty, we know he was at the scene of the crime that night". No one in the jury is going to be convinced by this argument! The lawyer must find explicit evidence that the defendant was at the scene of the crime that night.]

**You mustn't claim something is true without having justified it**. This might simply involve showing it to be true in the proof, or referring to a previously proved conjecture.

**Note:** The first of these means you haven't actually started a proof. The second is not too much of a problem and is easily rectified. The last two would mean you *have* started a proof but that it contains fundamental problems.

<!-- From Sheffield -->
<!-- ## $=$, $\Rightarrow$ and $\Leftrightarrow$ -->

<!-- Finally, we discuss the important mathematical symbols "$\Rightarrow$", "$\Leftrightarrow$" and "$=$", and how they should be used in proofs. -->

<!-- ### The equals sign -->

<!-- The equals sign, "$=$", is used to denote an equality between mathematics expressions (not statements). So for example,  -->

<!-- \begin{align} -->
<!--   1+1=2 -->
<!-- \end{align} -->

<!-- or -->

<!-- \begin{align} -->
<!--   \sin^2 \theta + \cos^2 \theta = 1 -->
<!-- \end{align} -->

<!-- ### The implies sign -->

<!-- The implies sign, "$\Rightarrow$", is used to denote when one mathematical statement follows directly from another. For example -->

<!-- \begin{align} -->
<!--   x &= 3 \Rightarrow x^2 = 9 -->
<!-- \end{align} -->

<!-- which is read "if $x$ equals three then $x$ squared equals nine". Note that it would be wrong to write -->

<!-- \begin{align} -->
<!--   x^2 = 9 \Rightarrow x &= 3 -->
<!-- \end{align} -->

<!-- as $x^2 = 9$ doesn't mean that $x$ is definitely $3$ (it could be $-3$). -->

<!-- ### The equivalence sign -->

<!-- The equivalence sign, "$\Leftrightarrow$", is used to denote the equivalence of two mathematical statements. If $A$ and $B$ are mathematical statements, then writing $A \Leftrightarrow B$ means that both $A \Rightarrow B$ and $B \Rightarrow A$ are true. For example, -->

<!-- \begin{align} -->
<!--     x - 1 &= 0 \Leftrightarrow x = 1 -->
<!-- \end{align} -->

<!-- Note that it would be wrong to write -->

<!-- \begin{align} -->
<!--     x^2 &= 9 \Leftrightarrow x = 3 -->
<!-- \end{align} -->

<!-- but correct to write -->

<!-- \begin{align} -->
<!--     x^2 &= 9 \Leftrightarrow x = \pm 3 -->
<!-- \end{align} -->

## Some useful arrows

The arrows $\Rightarrow$, $\Leftarrow$, $\Leftrightarrow$ describe relationships that can be represented with Venn diagrams.

For sets $A$ and $B$:

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="90%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics(rep("figures/venns1.png"))
```

If $A$ is not a subset of $B$, or $B$ is not a subset of $A$, then we cannot use these arrows:

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="50%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics(rep("figures/venns2.png"))
```

## Example

Let's look at an example of a good proof and a bad proof. Both are trying to prove the following conjecture:

(\#cnj:red): If $a$ is odd, the $3a$ is odd.

### A good proof

First, the good proof.

<div class="alert alert-success" role="alert">
```{proof}
Our starting point, $P$, is that $a$ is odd. As $a$ is odd, we can express it as
\begin{align}
  a &= 2k + 1 (\#eq:abe)
\end{align}
where $k$ is an integer.
Then
\begin{align}
  3a &= 3(2k + 1) (\#eq:chick) \\
  &= 6k + 3 (\#eq:maybe) \\
  &= 6k + 2 + 1 (\#eq:load) \\
  &= 2(3k + 1) + 1 (\#eq:neigh)
\end{align}
which is odd.

```
</div>

Here are a couple of things to notice:

- This conjecture was not difficult to prove, so the proof shouldn't be overly complicated. The presentation above demonstrates how to write a clear, comprehensive, cohesive and rigorous (watertight) argument.

- We label the conjecture with its reference number from the textbook, in this case "Conjecture \@ref(cnj:red)", so that if we need to we can refer back to it and its proof/disproof later. As we'll see in a later chapter, we often use work we've done previously, and having a quick way to refer back to previous conjectures and their proofs/disproof can speed this up for us!
    
- Every line in the proof above is labelled with a reference number: \@ref(eq:abe), \@ref(eq:chick), \@ref(eq:maybe), \@ref(eq:load), \@ref(eq:neigh). In your proofs, you probably won't need or want to label every line of work, but you should label important lines, ones which you use later in the proof (or even later in proofs of other conjectures!)

- Notice that we used the $\square$ symbol to indicate that we consider the proof is finished.

### A bad proof

Now for the bad proof.

<div class="alert alert-success" role="alert">

\begin{align}
  a = 2k + 1 &= 3(2k + 1) \\
  &= 2(3k + 1) + 1
\end{align}

</div>

Whilst the same reasoning underpins this proof as the proof above, it is far from easy to understand for the reader. Also, not writing out each step means the author of the proof runs the risk of making mistakes, which are then harder to spot. Finally, there are some plain mathematical mistakes ($2k + 1 \neq 3(2k + 1)$), even though we know what the author meant!

<!-- Here's another example which demonstrates this: -->

<!-- Let -->
<!-- \begin{align} -->
<!--   x=y -->
<!-- \end{align} -->
<!--   As $x=y$, -->
<!-- \begin{align} -->
<!--     y(x-y) &= x(x-y) (\#eq:noone) -->
<!-- \end{align} -->
<!--   Also, -->
<!-- \begin{align} -->
<!--     & x(x-y) = x^2 - xy - x^2 - y^2 = (x+y)(x-y) = 2y(x-y) (\#eq:reign) -->
<!-- \end{align} -->
<!--   So, -->
<!-- \begin{align} -->
<!--   y(x-y) &= 2y(x-y) (\#eq:rain) -->
<!-- \end{align} -->
<!--   and so -->
<!-- \begin{align} -->
<!--   1 &= 2 (\#eq:decide) -->
<!-- \end{align} -->

<!-- ## Exercises -->
