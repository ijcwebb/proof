# Induction

```{exercise}
Some of these conjectures are false; disprove them by finding a counterexample. Some of them are true; prove them using one (or a combination of more than one) of the methods we've met so far.

```

(\#cnj:point): $8a - 1$ is divisible by $7$ for any positive integer $a$.

(\#cnj:pain): For any positive integer $a$, $5^a - 1$ is divisible by $4$.

(\#cnj:partner): The sum of two consecutive positive integers is odd. <br /> *We have proved this theorem before, but try to prove it again using induction.*
        
(\#cnj:peasant): The sum of the first $a$ positive odd numbers equals $a^2$.
        
(\#cnj:parade): Any group of students is able to be split up into groups of twos, groups of threes, or a combination of groups of twos and threes.
        
(\#cnj:pleasant): Any group of students greater than two is able to be split up into groups of threes, groups of fours, or a combination of groups of threes and fours.
        
(\#cnj:patch): Any amount greater than or equal to 12 soms can be made using an infinite supply of 4-som and 5-som coins.

(\#cnj:prayer): Every negative integer is either even or odd. <br /> *Section 18.4 discusses using a proof by induction in the opposite direction (towards negative infinity). See Conjecture \@ref(cnj:progress) for the non-negative version of this.*
        
(\#cnj:pillow): $2^a > a$ for all negative integers $a$.

(\#cnj:prey): Every row of Pascal's Triangle is a power of $11$. <br /> *The first six rows of Pascal's Triangle are shown below^[Source: https://www.livescience.com/51238-properties-of-pascals-triangle.html.], but this conjecture says that **every** row (till infinity) is a power of $11$. For example $1$ is a power of $11$ ($11^0=1$), $11$ is a power of $11$, $121$ is a power of $11$, $1331$ is a power of $11$, etc.*

(\#cnj:prickly): $1^2$, $11^2$, $111^2$, $1111^2$, ... are all palindromic numbers.^[A palindromic number is one that reads the same backwards as it does forwards, e.g. $987789$ and $434$. Similarly, a word is palindromic if it reads the same backwards as it does forwards, e.g. *racecar* and *noon*. Sentences can be palindromic too, usually by ignoring spaces and punctuation, e.g. "*No lemon, no melon*" or "*Was it a cat I saw?*".]

(\#cnj:private): The product of three odd numbers is odd.
  
(\#cnj:petty): The product of any amount of odd numbers is odd.

(\#cnj:platform): There are no two integers $a$ and $b$ where $a^2 = b^3$, with $a$, $b > 1$.

<!-- The only numbers which can be classed as "odd" or "even" are integers (integers). -->

(\#cnj:pheasant): The interior angles of the octagon formed by joining the midpoint of each side of a square with each corner of the square are not all equal. <br /> *Hint: Draw the picture first!*

(\#cnj:pan): Squares of odd numbers are all one more than a multiple of $8$.

(\#cnj:peak): If $a + b < 15$, then at least one of $a$ and $b$ is less than $8$.
<!-- \item If $r + s = 2$ for two numbers $r$ and $s$, then either $r \geq 1$ or $s \geq 1$. -->
<!-- \item If $a + b \leq 4$ ($a, b$ any real numbers) then either $a \leq 1$ or $b \leq 3$. -->
<!-- \item If $a + b + z = 20$, then $a \geq 10$ or $a \geq 6$ or $a \geq 4$. -->

(\#cnj:passion): There's no positive integer $a$ such that the deletion of its first digit divides it by $2$.
<!-- There's no positive integer $a$ such that the deletion of its first digit divides it by 11. STRANGE -->
<!-- There's no positive integer $a$ such that the deletion of its first digit divides it by 35. -->

(\#cnj:please): There's only \textit{one} positive integer that is equal to the sum of all the positive integers less than it. 
<!-- INDUCTION?? -->

(\#cnj:person): Every positive odd integer is equal to the difference of two perfect squares. 
<!-- (induction, visual, direct too??) -->

(\#cnj:penchant): If an integer $a$ is not divisible by $3$, then $a^2 = 3k + 1$ for some integer $k$.

(\#cnj:perchance): If $a^2 = b^2$, then $a = b$.

<!-- (\#cnj:halt): DELETE If an integer $a$ is not divisible by 3,  then $n^2=3k+1$ where $k$ is a integer -->

<!-- Today's date is 03/12/2020, which contains lots of repeated digits: three 0's and three 2's. The last three dates with *no* repeated digits were probably before you were born: 23/06/1987, 24/06/1987 and 25/06/1987. <br /> (\#cnj:handicap): The next date this will happen is over 300 years in the future. -->
        
<!-- The game Tenzi (https://ilovetenzi.com) uses forty 6-sided dice, each numbered 1 to 6. <br /> (\#cnj:heroine): If you roll all forty dice at the same time, at least seven will land on the same number. -->

<!-- You have 27 small cubes, 3 each of nine different colours. <br /> (\#cnj:hypothesis): You can use all these small cubes to make a 3 x 3 x 3 cube so that *each* face of the bigger cube contains one of each of the nine colours. -->
