# More conjectures I: Assorted

What follows are more conjectures, *some* of which will require one of the three methods mentioned in this chapter, other which are false, and others which can be proved using another method from this textbook.

They are not ordered by difficulty, so if you get stuck, you can move onto the next one without worrying that it will be even harder! 

I have grouped some similar theorems together. However, this doesn't mean you will prove (or disprove) them in a similar way, though they may rely on each other.

**Rational and irrational numbers:** A rational number is a number that can be expressed as the ratio of two integers. <br /> For example $4$ is rational because $4$ can be written as $\frac{4}{1}$ or $\frac{8}{2}$ or $\frac{100}{25}$ etc. <br /> $-3.5$ is rational because it can be written as $\frac{-7}{2}$ or $\frac{-35}{10}$ etc. <br /> $\frac{1}{9} = 0.1111...$ and so $0.1111...$ is a rational number. <br /> $0.142857142857142857...$ is rational because it is $1$ divided by $7$. <br /> $\pi$ is not rational because it can't be written as a fraction of integers.

(\#cnj:japes): There is no rational number $a$ for which $a^3 + a + 1 = 0$.

(\#cnj:jade): The ratio of two rational numbers is rational.

(\#cnj:joke): The sum of two rational numbers is rational.

(\#cnj:jagers): Every integer greater than $3$ is equal to the sum of the squares of two integers.

(\#cnj:jaghir): Same as the previous conjecture, but for $4$ instead of $3$.

(\#cnj:jagirs): Ask a friend to give you three numbers. The sum of these numbers will always be a multiple of $3$.

(\#cnj:jailed): If $a,b,c$ is a Pythagorean triple, then  at least one of $a,b,c$ is odd. 
<!-- [Disprove by multiplying an existing PT by 4] -->

(\#cnj:jailer): If $a,b,c$ is a Pythagorean triple, with $a,b < c$, then $a$ and $b$ can't both be odd.

(\#cnj:jailor): $a^7 - a$ is divisible by $7$ for all positive integers $a$.

(\#cnj:jakeys): $3a + 5b$ (where $a$ and $b$ are integers) is even only when $a$ is	odd	and	$b$ is odd.

(c-e)

(\#cnj:jalops): For all positive numbers $a, \frac{1}{a} < a$.

(\#cnj:jalopy): The only way for both $ab$ and $a + b$ to be even is if both $a$ and $b$ are even.

(\#cnj:jambed): There are as many even numbers as natural numbers (even though there even numbers are a subset of the natural numbers).
<!-- Use Hilbert’s hotel to understand this, everyone has a room. -->

A 52-card deck contains 4 suites (hearts, diamonds, clubs and spades) which each contain 13 different values (A, 1, 2,..., 10, J, Q, K).

- What's the smallest number of cards you need to draw to guarantee that you have a pair? Prove your answer.
- What's the smallest number of cards you need to draw to guarantee that you have a three-of-a-kind? Prove your answer.
- What's the smallest number of cards you need to draw to guarantee that you have a flush (for example, five diamonds)? Prove your answer.

The popular TV show *Tame of Gnomes* has had 115 episodes. You've watched 60 so far. <br /> (\#cnj:jambos): At least two episodes that you've watched are exactly four episodes apart.

You decide to play a game: who knows the most people (excluding you!). <br /> (\#cnj:jambul): At least two people know *exactly* the same number of people at the party. (You can assume that if person $A$ knows person $B$, then person $B$ knows person $A$.)

You live in The Gyzkyr Republic, which issues 5-sym and 8-sym coins, and 10-sym and 50-sym notes.

- What's the largest amount you cannot pay for?
- What's the largest amount you cannot pay for using only coins?

(\#cnj:jambus): Above a certain price, *any* price can be paid for using an even number of both coins. (Not necessarily the same number of each coin.)

(\#cnj:jamjar): To pay for an item which is evenly-priced, you must use an even number of at least one of the coins.

(\#cnj:jammed): To pay for an item priced 72 syms, you must use at least 6 of one of the coins.
