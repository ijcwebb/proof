# Proof by contrapositive

Look back at the definition of the **contrapositive** from Chapter 15. Do you notice something? The contrapositive always has the same truth value as the original conjecture $P \Rightarrow Q$. If one of them is true, the other is too. If one of them is false, the other is too.

Sometimes it can be easier to prove the contrapositive is true than to prove the original conjecture $P \Rightarrow Q$ is true. As they have identical truth values, this gives us a useful way of proving conjectures: If $T \Rightarrow S$ is true, then $P \Rightarrow Q$ is true. We use this method in this chapter. <br /> <br />

<div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert">
<strong>Why?</strong> 

To see why a conjecture $P \Rightarrow Q$ and its contrapositive $T \Rightarrow S$ have identical truth values, consider this: **Every element on the left hand side of a conjecture map *must* travel to the right hand side.** Therefore every element from both $P$ and $S$ must find a home in either $Q$ or $T$. 

A conjecture $P \Rightarrow Q$ asserts that *all* elements in $P$ end up in $Q$. Therefore if there are any elements in $T$, how did they get there? They of course came from the left hand side, but the conjecture maintains that they definitely didnâ€™t come from $P$, as all elements in $P$ went to $Q$. Therefore, if the conjecture $P \Rightarrow Q$ is true, then any element in $T$ must have come from $S$.

Proof by contrapositive exploits this fact, proving the every element in $P$ goes to $Q$ by proving that every element in $T$ started out in $S$ (or simply $T \Rightarrow S$ proves $P \Rightarrow Q$).

## Steps

1. Write the conjecture $P \Rightarrow Q$ in the form **If...then...**.
2. Write the contrapositive $T \Rightarrow S$ in the form **If...then...**.
3. Prove $T \Rightarrow S$.
4. This proves $P \Rightarrow Q$.

## Formal definition

To prove conjecture "If $P$ then $Q$" by contrapositive, show that

<center>

$T \Rightarrow S$

</center>

where $T \Rightarrow S$ is the contrapositive of the original conjecture.

## Conjectures

```{exercise}
Use the following examples to practise proof by contrapositive. Consider why this method is easier than a direct proof for these conjectures.

(\#cnj:xats): If $a^2+b^2$ is odd and $a$ and $b$ are both integers, then $a$ or $b$ have different parity to one another.
  
(\#cnj:xat): Every multiple of $3$ can be written as the sum of three consecutive integers.

(\#cnj:xes): If $a+b$ is even, with $a,b \in \mathbb Z$, then $a$ and $b$ have the same parity as one another.

(\#cnj:xian): If $a$ is irrational, then $\frac{1}{a}$ is too.

Conjecture \@ref(cnj:xats): To prove this using a direct proof would require us to set $a^2 + b^2$ equal to $2k+1, k \in \mathbb Z$ (as we're told that it's odd) and then doing some crazy algebra involving three variables. 

A proof by contrapositive is probably going to be a lot easier here. We draw the map for the conjecture, to aid correct identification of the contrapositive.

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="90%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics(rep("figures/maps9.png"))
```

Note that an arrow representing $T \Rightarrow S$, the contrapositive of the original conjecture, has been added to the map.

```{proof} 
From the map, it's easy to see the contrapositive of the conjecture is "If $a, b$ both odd or both even, then $a^2+b^2$ is even".

**Case 1:** $a$, $b$ both odd.

We have
\begin{align}
    a &= 2k +1 \\
    b &= 2l + 1
\end{align}
where $k,l \in \mathbb Z$.

Then,
\begin{align}
    a^2 + b^2 &= (2k +1)^2 + (2l + 1)^2 \\
    &= 4k^2 + 4k + 1 + 4l^2 + 4l + 1  \\
    &= 4k^2 + 4k + 4l^2 + 4l + 2 \\
    &= 2(2k^2 + 2k + 2l^2 + 2l + 1) 
\end{align}
which is clearly even.

**Case 2:** $a$, $b$ both even

We have
\begin{align}
    a &= 2k \\
    b &= 2l
\end{align}
where $k,l \in \mathbb Z$.

Then,
\begin{align}
    a^2 + b^2 &= (2k)^2 + (2l)^2 \\
    &= 4k^2 + 4l^2  \\
    &= 2(2k^2 + 2l^2) 
\end{align}
which is clearly even.

We have proved the contrapositive, $T \Rightarrow S$, using two cases. We have thus proved the original conjecture $P\Rightarrow Q$.

Conjecture \@ref(cnj:xat): First, we rewrite the conjecture,

<center> If $a$ is a multiple of $3$, then $a$ can be expressed as the sum of three consecutive integers. <br /> <br /> </center>

We can easily see this conjecture holds for some small multiples of $3$, for example 

<center> $6=1+2+3$ <br /> </center> <center> $3 = 0 + 1 + 2$ <br /> </center> <center> $9=2+3+4$ <br /> </center> 

It also holds for $0$, which is a multiple of $3$: 

<center> $0=-1+0+1$ <br /> </center>  

And we can probably see that for any positive multiple of $3$ for which the conjecture holds, it will hold for the negative version of that number, for example

<center> $-6=(-1)+(-2)+(-3)$<br /> </center>  

However, to try to prove it holds for all positive multiples of $3$ doesn't seem an obvious task. For example, are you *sure* that $561$ (which is a multiple of $3$) can be expressed as the sum of three consecutive integers? 

A proof by contrapositive might be easier; let's try. We draw the map for the conjecture, to aid correct identification of the contrapositive.

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics(rep("figures/maps10.png"))
```

Again, an arrow representing $T \Rightarrow S$, the contrapositive of the original conjecture, has been added to the map.

```{proof}
From the map, it's easy to see the contrapositive of the conjecture is "If $a$ cannot be expressed as the multiple of $3$ consecutive numbers, then $a$ is not a multiple of $3$".

If $a$ cannot be expressed as the multiple of $3$ consecutive numbers, then we know that there is no integer $b$ for which $a = b + (b+1) + (b+2)$. Therefore,
\begin{align}
  a &\neq b + b+1 + b+2 \\
\end{align}
where $b \in \mathbb Z$.

Using simple algebra, this becomes
\begin{align}
  a & \neq 3b + 3 \\
   & \neq 3(b+1) \\
   & \neq 3c \\
\end{align}
where $c=b+1$ and $c \in \mathbb Z$.

Therefore $a$ is not a multiple of $3$. We have proved the contrapositive, and therefore we've proved the original conjecture.

<!-- If $a+b$ is even, with $a,b \in \mathbb$, then $a$ and $b$ have the same parity. -->
Conjecture \@ref(cnj:xes): A direct proof of this conjecture would require setting $a+b$ equal to $2k$, $k \in \mathbb Z$ and then doing algebra. 

Might a proof by contrapositive be easier here? We draw the map for the conjecture, to aid correct identification of the contrapositive.

Again, an arrow representing $T \Rightarrow S$, the contrapositive of the original conjecture, has been added to the map.

```{proof}
From the map, it's easy to see the contrapositive of the conjecture is "If $a$ and $b$, with $a,b \in \mathbb Z$, have different parity, then $a+b$ is odd."

$a$ and $b$, with $a,b \in \mathbb Z$, have different parity. W.l.o.g. let $a$ be odd and thus $b$ even Thus,
\begin{align}
  a &= 2k+1 \\
  b &= 2l
\end{align}
where $k,l \in \mathbb Z$.

Then
\begin{align}
  a+b &= (2k+1) + 2l \\
   &= 2(k + l) + 1 
\end{align}
which is odd, as $(k+l) \in \mathbb Z$. We've proved the contrapositive, and thus proved the original conjecture.

Conjecture \@ref(cnj:xian): As we don't have an algebraic way to express the family of irrational numbers, but do have an algebraic way to express the family of rational numbers,^[See https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vQZLBbHTEunXLfb_ylj08CVcDncvXdnumcJ8rDGWSa1bwGRr-UYSU2eyubpwifi548abUJyAqXSOghN/pub.] a proof by contrapositive is probably going to be a lot easier than a direct proof of $P \Rightarrow Q$.

Again, an arrow representing $T \Rightarrow S$, the contrapositive of the original conjecture, has been added to the map.

```{proof} 
From the map, it's easy to see the contrapositive of the conjecture is "If $\frac{1}{a}$ is rational, then so is $a$".

If $\frac{1}{a}$ is rational, then it be expressed as
\begin{align}
  \frac{1}{a} &=  \frac{k}{l}
\end{align}
where $k,l \in \mathbb Z$.

Then using simple algebra,
\begin{align}
  \frac{1}{\frac{k}{l}} &=  \frac{1}{\frac{1}{a}} \\
  \frac{l}{k} &=  a \\
\end{align}
and so $a$ is rational. We have proved the contrapositive, which proves the original conjecture.

<!-- (\#cnj:xi): The product of two non-integers is never an integer. (This was Conjecture 11.10.) -->
<!-- Conjecture \@ref(cnj:xi): Rewritten, this conjecture becomes "If $a,b \notin \mathbb Z$, then $ab \notin \mathbb Z$".

For example, let $ab = 1 = \frac{3}{5} \times \frac{5}{3}$. Or let $ab = 2 = \sqrt{2} \times \sqrt{2}$. As we've found counterexamples to the contrapositive, we know the original conjecture is false too.  -->
