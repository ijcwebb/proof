# Maps revisited

## $\Rightarrow$ revisited

We discussed the symbol "$\Rightarrow$" in Chapter 9. Another way of interpreting this symbol is that for sets $A$ and $B$, $A \Rightarrow B$ means

<center> “*all* elements in $A$ go to $B$”. <br /> <br /> </center>

This definition of $\Rightarrow$ will be useful for this chapter.

## More relations within a map

Consider the (empty) conjecture map below:

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="35%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics(rep("figures/maps5.png"))
```

The conjectures we will meet in this course are generally of the form $P \Rightarrow Q$ (e.g. "The product of three consecutive integers is divisible by $6$", "For any negative number $a$, $a^2 >a$", "All primes are odd"). In other words:

- $P \Rightarrow Q$: ALL elements in $P$ go to $Q$ (and never to $T$).

Some other possible relationships within this map are:

- $P \Rightarrow T$: ALL elements in $P$ go to $T$ (and never to $Q$). 
- $S \Rightarrow Q$: ALL elements in $S$ go to $Q$ (and never to $T$).
- $S \Rightarrow T$: ALL elements in $S$ go to $T$ (and never to $Q$).

The following relationships are also possible, but are different from those four above:

- $Q \Rightarrow P$: ALL elements in $Q$ came from $P$ (i.e. no elements in $S$ go to $Q$).
- $T \Rightarrow P$: ALL elements in $T$ came from $P$ (i.e. no elements in $S$ go to $T$).
- $Q \Rightarrow S$: ALL elements in $Q$ came from $S$ (i.e. no elements in $P$ go to $Q$).
- $T \Rightarrow S$: ALL elements in $T$ came from $S$ (i.e. no elements in $P$ go to $T$).

Let's practise... 

<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
```{exercise}
Take a look at the following conjecture map^[This map assumes that gender is binary, at least within our class, so that each student identifies definitively as female or male. In fact, many people don't neatly fit into either of the categories "male" or "female", and identify themselves as having a non-binary gender. Therefore this example is overly simplistic and is used only for illustrative purposes.]:

</div>

***Solution:***

\textcolor{white}{blank} | **Statement** | **Truth value**  | **Justification** | **Counterexample (if false)**
-----  | ----------------- | ------  | ---------------------------- | -----
$P \Rightarrow Q$ | If $a$ is even, then $ka$ is even^[The word *always* is implied here, and in all other statements in this table.], for $k \in \mathbb Z$. | True | An even integer multiplied by any integer remains even | No counterexample exists
$P \Rightarrow T$ | If $a$ is even, then $ka$ is odd, for $k \in \mathbb Z$. | False | Because $P \Rightarrow Q$ | $a=2, k=1$. <br /> Then  <br /> $ka=2  \neq$ odd.
$S \Rightarrow Q$ | If $a$ is odd, then $ka$ is even, for $k \in \mathbb Z$. | False | *Sometimes* an odd integer multiplied by another integer is even (if the second integer is even) but not always. We can't use $\Rightarrow$ unless *every* element of $S$ goes to $Q$ | $a=1, k=1$. <br /> Then  <br /> $ka=1 \neq$ even.
$S \Rightarrow T$ | If $a$ is odd, then $ka$ is odd, for $k \in \mathbb Z$. | False | For the same reason that $S \Rightarrow Q$ is false. *Sometimes* an odd integer multiplied by another integer is odd (if the second integer is odd) but not always. We can't use $\Rightarrow$ unless *every* element of $S$ goes to $T$ | $a=1, k=2$. <br /> Then  <br /> $ka=2 \neq$ odd.
$Q \Rightarrow P$ | If $ka$ is even, with $k \in \mathbb Z$, then $a$ is even. | False | Not all elements in $Q$ came from $P$ - some came from $S$ | $ka=2, k=2$. <br /> Then  <br /> $a=1 \neq$ even.
$T \Rightarrow P$ | If $ka$ is odd, with $k \in \mathbb Z$, then $a$ is even. |  False | In fact, no elements in $T$ come from $P$. | $ka=3, k=1$. <br /> Then  <br /> $a=3 \neq$ even.
$Q \Rightarrow S$ | If $ka$ is even, with $k \in \mathbb Z$, then $a$ is odd. | False | Some elements in $Q$ came from $S$ but some came from $P$. | $ka=2, k=1$. <br /> Then  <br /> $a=2 \neq$ odd.
$T \Rightarrow S$ | If $ka$ is odd, with $k \in \mathbb Z$, then $a$ is odd. |  True | Any element in $T$ definitely came from $S$ (i.e. none came from $P$). | No counterexample exists

<!-- These four relationships have subtle distinctions, and you should try to make sure you are happy with the difference between them. Do you understand why $P \Rightarrow Q$ is different to $Q \Leftarrow P$, for instance? To test yourself, attempt the following exercise. -->

<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
```{exercise}
Consider the following conjecture map:

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="70%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics(rep("figures/maps7.png"))
```

Which of the eight relationships above are true for this map?

Be careful! According to this map, we know only that $a^2$ is an integer (hence why we can partition the $a^2$s into evens and odds) but not whether $a$ is an integer.
</div>

***Solution:***

- $P \Rightarrow Q$, "If $a^2$ is even, then $a$ is even", is **false**.^[This is Conjecture 12.23 from Chapter 12.] <br /> Counterexample: $a^2 = 2$, $a=\sqrt{2} \neq$ an even number.

- $P \Rightarrow T$, "If $a^2$ is even, then $a$ is not even", is **false**. <br /> Counterexample: $a^2 = 4$, $a=2 =$ an even number.
- $S \Rightarrow Q$, "If $a^2$ is odd, then $a$ is even", is **false**. <br /> Counterexample: $a^2 = 9$, $a=3 \neq$ an even number.
- $S \Rightarrow T$, "If $a^2$ is odd, then $a$ is not even", is **true**.
- $Q \Rightarrow P$, "If $a$ is even, then $a^2$ is even", is **true**.
- $T \Rightarrow P$, "If $a$ is not even, then $a^2$ is even", is **false**. <br /> Counterexample: $a = 1$, $a^2=1 \neq$ an even number.
- $Q \Rightarrow S$, "If $a$ is even, then $a^2$ is odd", is **false**. <br /> Counterexample: $a = 2$, $a^2=4 \neq$ an odd number.
- $T \Rightarrow S$, "If $a$ is not even, then $a^2$ is odd", is **false**. <br /> Counterexample: $a = 1.1$, $a^2=1.21 \neq$ an odd number.

## A conjecture and its negation, converse, inverse, and contrapositive

Some of the eight relationships that we've looked at in this chapter have special names.

$P \Rightarrow Q$ is a particular **conjecture** that we are trying to prove. If it's true, we say "The conjecture is true" and if it's false we say "The conjecture is false".

In relation to a particular conjecture $P \Rightarrow Q$:

$P \Rightarrow T$ is called the **negation** of the conjecture. If the conjecture $P \Rightarrow Q$ is true, then the negation is false. If the conjecture $P \Rightarrow Q$ is false, then the negation might be true. Can you see why?

$S \Rightarrow T$ is called the **inverse** of the conjecture. The truth value of the original conjecture and its inverse have no relation to one another: they can both be true, they can both be false, or they can have opposing truth values. Can you see why?

$Q \Rightarrow P$ is called the **converse** of the conjecture. If the conjecture $P \Rightarrow Q$ is false, then the converse is false. If the conjecture $P \Rightarrow Q$ is true, then the converse might be true. Can you see why?

$T \Rightarrow S$ is called the **contrapositive** of the conjecture. If the original conjecture is true, the contrapositive is true too. If the original conjecture is false, the contrapositive is false too.

The picture below illustrates these four special relationships, along with the original conjecture $P \Rightarrow Q$.

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="40%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics(rep("figures/negationetc.png"))
```

Note that the relationships $S \Rightarrow Q$, $T \Rightarrow P$ and $Q \Rightarrow S$ don't have particular names.
