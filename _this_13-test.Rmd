# Proof by cases

Our third method of proof is a beautiful method, called **proof by cases**. Proving something by cases is very similar to proving something by exhaustion. 

## Steps

The steps in a proof by cases are similar to those in a proof by exhaustion:

1. Partition $P$ into cases. <br /> *Note that a partition of $P$ into "*cases*" is similar to the list of possibilities you create for a proof by exhaustion, except that cases are generally more broad (usually containing multiple elements) than each single possibility in a proof by exhaustion.*

2. Show that the conjecture is true for each of the cases on your list. <br /> *In a proof by exhaustion, you had to show that the conjecture was true for each possibility, which usually required testing just a single number. Similarly for a proof by cases, you need to show that $P \rightarrow Q$ for each case, but as cases generally contain more elements, something like a direct proof will be needed for each case.*

<!-- For example, while the list of possibilities in a proof by exhaustion might be each whole number from 1 to 20 or each possible route taken by a knight on a chessboard, the cases in a proof by cases might be *all* negative numbers and *all* non-negative numbers, or *all* even integers between 1 and 20 and *all* odd integers between 1 and 20, or *all* whole numbers and *all* non-whole numbers. -->

Here are some examples of how you might split up a proof into cases (Step 1), depending on what type of number the conjecture concerns:

**Family** | **Possible cases** 
------------- | ------------- 
$a \in \mathbb Z$ | **Case 1:** $a$ is even <br /> **Case 2:** $a$ is odd <br /> <br /> **Case 1:**  $a = 3k$ <br /> **Case 2:** $a = 3k + 1$ <br /> **Case 3:** $a = 3k + 2$ with $k \in \mathbb Z$ <br /> <br /> **Case 1:** $a$ is positive <br /> **Case 2:** $a$ is negative <br /> **Case 3:** $a$ = 0
$a \in \mathbb R$ | **Case 1:** $a$  is rational <br /> **Case 2:** $a$ is irrational <br /> <br /> **Case 1:** $|a| > 1$ <br /> **Case 2:** $|a| \leq 1$ <br /> <br /> **Case 1:** $a$ is positive <br /> **Case 2:** $a$ is negative <br /> **Case 3:** $a$ = 0
Pairs of numbers $a, b$ | **Case 1:** both $a, b > 0$ <br /> **Case 2:** both $a, b < 0$ <br /> **Case 3:** $a > 0$ and $b < 0$ (w.l.o.g.) <br /> **Case 4:** at least one of $a$ and $b$ equals 0 <br /> <br /> **Case 1:** $a,b \neq 0$ <br /> **Case 2:** at least one of $a$ and $b$ equals 0

<strong>Note:
</strong> 

- You might partition $P$ into cases differently to a classmate. Don't worry! There are many ways to prove the same thing - just make sure you don't miss any numbers! 
<!-- For example, if $P$ says $a$ is an integer and -->

<!-- - you split the proof into positive integers and negative integers, then you have forgotten to consider $a = 0$, and your cases are not complete. You will have to amend one of the two cases to include $a = 0$, or add it as its own case.  -->

<!-- - you split the proof into cases $a \geq 0$ and $a \leq 0$, then 0 is contained in both cases, meaning the cases overlap, which also isn't good. You should amend one of the cases so it no longer includes 0. -->

- Once you have partitioned $P$ into cases, consider each case separately from one another. 

- For conjectures in this course that require a proof by cases, you will probably need 2, 3, or maybe 4 cases. However, there is no upper limit for how many you can use. Proofs involving between 5 and 10 cases are common. You should always try to use the smallest number of cases possible.^[The first proof of the *Four Colour Theorem* used 1936 cases. Since then, mathematicians have managed to reduce this number to close to 600, which is still a lot, but less than 1936! <br /> The Four Colour Theorem states that any map, like a map of the states of the U.S. or countries of the world, can be coloured using only four colours in such a way that regions sharing a common boundary (other than a single point) do not share the same colour. In other words, a cartographer knows that she needs only four colours to colour *any* map.]

## Formal definition

To prove "If $P$ then $Q$" by cases, show that

<center>

If $P_1$ then $Q$.

If $P_2$ then $Q$.

$\vdots$

If $P_n$ then $Q$.

</center>

where $P_1$, $P_2$, ..., $P_n$ is a partition of $P$.

## Exhaustion versus cases

Let's compare a couple of conjectures we previously proved by exhaustion and a couple which can be proved using cases, to see the difference between "*possibilities*" in a proof by exhaustion and "*cases*" in a proof by cases.

**Conjecture** | **Proof by exhaustion** | **Proof by cases**
------------- | ------------- | -------------
Conjecture 11.4 (from Chapter 11) | The video solution identified four possible divisors of $97$ (using some clever reasoning about prime numbers and the square root of $97$ to not identify more possibilities than necessary) and then checked them all. Finding none divided $97$, and being satisfied that this list of candidate divisors was complete, the conjecture was declared true. <br /> **List of possibilities:** $2, 3, 5, 7$. |
Conjecture 11.3 (from Chapter 11) | In the video solution, the list of possibilities was identified as the integers $0, 1, 2, 3, ..., 9$. Again, this list was long enough to ensure completeness but not longer than it needed to be. <br /> **List of possibilities:** $0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9$. |
(\#cnj:hobby): Integers retain their parity when squared. || We should first check the conjecture is true for even integers, then check it's true for odd integers.  <br /> **Partition of $a \in \mathbb Z$ into cases:**  <br /> **Case 1:** All even integers. <br /> **Case 2:** All odd integers.  
(\#cnj:have): For $a, b \in \mathbb R$, $|a + b| \leq |a| + |b|$. || As we're dealing with the modulus function^[Recall the modulus function: $|a| = a$ for $a \geq 0$, and $|a| = -a$ for $a < 0$.], it  makes sense to build cases by varying the sign of $a$ and $b$. <br /> **Partition of $a \in \mathbb R$ into cases:**  <br /> **Case 1:** $a$ and $b$ both $\geq 0$. <br /> **Case 2:** $a$ and $b$ both $< 0$. <br /> **Case 3:** $a \geq 0$ and $b <0$. <br /> **Case 4:** $a < 0$ and $b \geq 0$. 
(\#cnj:haunt): There is no integer $a$ such that $a^2 + a^3 = 100$. | | **Partition of $a \in \mathbb Z$ into cases:**  <br /> **Case 1:** $a \in \mathbb Z^-$ <br /> **Case 2:** $a=0$ <br /> **Case 3:** $1 \leq a \leq 4$ <br /> **Case 4:** $a \geq 5$ 
(\#cnj:hallway): All perfect squares are either a multiple of $3$ or one more than a multiple of $3$. | | See **Exercise 13.3** below.

## Conjectures

<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
```{exercise}
We have already met the following four conjectures above. Use them to practice the method of proof by cases. Solutions are below.
  
(\#cnj:hobby): Integers retain their parity when squared.

(\#cnj:have): For $a, b \in \mathbb R$, $|a + b| \leq |a| + |b|$.

(\#cnj:haunt): There is no integer $a$ such that $a^2 + a^3 = 100$.

(\#cnj:hallway): *All* perfect squares are either a multiple of $3$ or one more than a multiple of $3$.

***Solutions:***

***

Conjecture \@ref(cnj:wave): First, we rewrite the conjecture,

<center> If $a$ and $b$ are even integers, then $a+b$ is even. </center>

Now we're ready for a direct proof.

```{proof}
Since $a$ and $b$ are even, they can be written as
\begin{align}
    a &= 2k \\
    b &= 2l
\end{align}
where $k$ and $l$ are integers. Therefore the sum of $a$ and $b$ is
\begin{align}
    a + b &= 2k + 2l\\
    &= 2(k + l)
\end{align} 
by factoring out 2.

As the sum of integers equals an integer, $k + l$ must equal some integer. Let's call it $m$. Therefore we have
\begin{align}
    a + b &= 2m
\end{align}
which is clearly even.
```
