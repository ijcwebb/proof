# Writing your own conjectures task

<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
```{exercise}
For this exercise, I want you to look back over *all* the previous conjectures we've proved and disproved and use your findings to write some new conjectures.

<!-- Something slightly different today: -->

<!-- This chapter was all about using previously proved (or disproved) conjectures to aid your work on new proofs. -->

Here are the rules:

Each student should write at least two conjectures. 
    
- The conjectures should be true.
    
- The conjectures should be provable using work which you and your classmates have previously done, and using the methods we've already met: direct proof and exhaustion.
    
- DON'T rush - take your time to write these conjectures.
    
- Post your conjectures onto the padlet. <br /> **Note:** Post each conjecture whenever it's ready to go!
    
- If you still have time remaining in class OR as homework, try to solve some of your classmates' conjectures. Post your proof **underneath** their post.  <br /> **Note:** DON'T solve too many conjectures - leave some for other people to solve!!
    
- If there are no unsolved conjectures left on the padlet, try solving one of the conjectures already solved. Maybe you can solve it in a different way??
    
- If you think your classmate has written a conjecture which is actually false, tell them by posting a disproof (or counterexample) under their post.
    
- If *your* conjecture is disproved by a classmate, can you modify it to make it true?

Good luck!
