# Axioms

Now that we fully understand what makes a statement mathematical, we should discuss **axioms**. 

## What makes a mathematical statement an axiom?

Axioms are mathematical statements which are true, and are self-evidently so. Basically, they are things so obviously true or so universally accepted, that when you read them, you say to yourself, "*Duh, of course!*"^[https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/duh]. Axioms should be so obvious, that when asked to prove them, you end up scratching your head and shouting "C'MON, IT JUST *IS* TRUE!!!!".

Axioms are the building blocks of mathematics. There is no complete list of them all, as we can always add more of them to the list. On our Miro board, I have created a space called **Our Axioms} where we'll store all the axioms which we may use in this course. Tell me if you find a statement which you believe is an axiom but isn't there.

<div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert">
<strong>Careful!</strong> 

What *you* might consider to be an axiom (something so obviously true that no proof is needed), someone else might believe is not self-evident and that a proof is needed. That's fine...if challenged to prove something that you believe is an axiom, rise to that challenge!
</div>

Rules of axioms:

- These describe a property of a mathematical object or operation.
- The property is not necessarily unique to the mathematical object, for example "$ab = ba$" for multiplication is also true of addition: "$a+b=b+a$", and "There are infinitely many ways to cut a circle into two equal halves" is also true for spheres: "There are infinitely many ways to cut a spheres into two equal halves"
- Axioms are mathematical statements which are TRUE, elementary and universally accepted, but which don't have proofs (because they are so fundamental).
- Axioms should never cover more than one property of an object or operation.
- Axioms should not be able to be derived from other axioms.

Here are a few axioms about **algebra**. Note that $a, b, c$ and $d$ can be *any* numbers.^[See https://www.aaamath.com/ac11.htm.]

- If $a = c$ then $c = a$.
- If $a = c$ and $b = c$, then $a = b$.
- If $a = b$ and $b = c$, then $a = c$.
- If $a = b$ and $c = d$, then $a + c = b + d$.
- $a \cdot b = b \cdot a$.
- If $a = b$ and $c = d$, then $ac = bd$.

Here are a few axioms about **geometry**:^[See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations_of_geometry % http://web.mit.edu/wwmath/vectorc/3d/old/axioms.html % https://www.ams.org/journals/tran/1904-005-03/S0002-9947-1904-1500678-X/S0002-9947-1904-1500678-X.pdf % http://www.mrc.uidaho.edu/~rwells/Critical%20Philosophy%20and%20Mind/Chapter%2023.pdf.]

- If you have two points, you can draw a straight line which connects them.
- If you have two points, you can always draw a circle with one of the points at the circle's centre and the other on its edge.
- There are infinitely many ways to cut a circle into two equal halves.
- A straight line can be extended in either direction forever.
- Three points can be arranged in such a way that they don't all lie on the same straight line.
- Four points can be arranged in such a way that they don't all lie on the same flat plane.

**Note:** All of the axioms above can be written in even briefer terms, though I haven't done so, in order to ensure clarity.

```{exercise}
Before our next class, I want you to think of one algebraic and one geometric statement which you believe are *so* obviously true that they are in fact axioms. Come to Tuesday's class ready to share your proposed axioms. Those which we all agree are axiomatic will be added to **Our Axioms** on Miro. Note that axioms should be nicely short and simple.

## What makes an axiom a definition?

Be careful! Some statements which seem really obvious and fundamental are actually *so* obvious and fundamental that they are **definitions**, not axioms. What's the difference between an axiom and a definition? Well, if you ever bought a Mathematics Dictionary, you would find definitions inside, not axioms.

Rules for definitions:

- These uniquely describe a mathematical object or operation
- Definitions answer the question, "What is a ...?", for example "What is a square" or "What is an even number?" or "What is multiplication?"
- Definitions can't be proved, they are just accepted.
- They allow us to all agree on key terms in mathematics.

Below are some statements which are definitions, not axioms. Each definition's subject is in **bold**.

- A **square number** (or **perfect square**) is the square of a whole number.
 - **Whole numbers** (or **integers**) are numbers with digits only to the left of the decimal point.
- **Non-whole numbers** are numbers which have value to the right of the decimal point (and possibly to the left too).
- Two whole numbers $a$ and $b$ are **consecutive** if either $b = a + 1$ or $a = b + 1$.
- $a$ **divides** $b$ if $b \div a$ leaves no remainder.
- **Even numbers** are whole numbers which can be written in the form $2n$, where $n$ is a whole number.
- **Odd numbers** are whole numbers which *cannot* be written in the form $2n$, where $n$ is a whole number.^[Alternatively: **Odd numbers** are whole numbers which can be written in the form $2n + 1$, where $n$ is a whole number.]
- The **absolute** (or **modulus**) of a negative number is the positive version of that number.
- A **point** has no length, width or height.
- A **line** has length but no width or height.

Below is an axiom, a definition and a (quite obvious) statement. Which is which?
            
Be careful - just because something seems obvious to you, that doesn't mean it's self-evidently true and an axiom of mathematics.
    
a. The sum of the digits of any number divisible by $9$ is itself divisible by $9$.
b. The product of two negative numbers is positive.
c. For two positive numbers $a$, $b$, $a$ is larger that $b$ if $a - b > 0$.

Come up with definitions of the following terms. Try to be concise, but sufficiently clear.

A square number (or perfect square) is the square of a whole number.

Whole numbers (or integers) are numbers with digits only to the left of the decimal point.

Non-whole numbers are numbers which have value to the right of the decimal point (and possibly to the left too).

$a$ divides $b$ if $b รท a$ leaves no remainder.

Even numbers are whole numbers which can be written in the form $2n$, where $n$ is a whole number.

Odd numbers are whole numbers which cannot be written in the form $2n$, where $n$ is a whole number.

<strong> What have we learnt? </strong> 

- Axioms are special kinds of mathematical statements; they are ones which are self-evidently true. They are the building blocks of mathematics.
    
- We've also learnt that *really* fundamental axioms are called definitions. They are how we are sure you, your fellow mathematicians and your reader all understand what you're talking about!^[See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuous_truth.]
