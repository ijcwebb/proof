Most weeks I will assign you a chapter to read, and you should complete both the reading and the exercises within the chapter before our next class. This is a living textbook, which means that it will be updated throughout the course. This is for two reasons: (i) because mistakes are noticed (by you or me) and corrections made, (ii) because I am still writing and improving sections of it. Therefore, even though you can read ahead of the set chapter, you are advised that later chapters might change. Also note that because this textbook will be updated during the course, you are advised to access the book at the link at https://ijcwebb.github.io/proof, rather than printing or downloading the book. 1.3 In this book Exercise 1.1 Regular exercises look like this with subparts like this. Solution. Solutions might be included underneath exercises, in which case you should aim to complete the exercise before checking the solution. If the solution is not included, then we will probably discuss it in class. Exercise 1.2 Extension exercises look like this. These are exercises that require a little more thought. Solutions wont be given in the book for these exercises, but we may discuss these in class. You can also book one-to-one consultations to discuss. Careful! This is where I alert you to mistakes commonly made by students in this course. Read these warnings carefully to avoid these mistakes yourself. What weve learnt These boxes are found at the end of each chapter, and recap the main things we have covered in the chapter. You can view these as key takeaways from the chapter. These often set us up for the next chapter too. \\[\\begin{equation} f\\left(k\\right) = \\binom{n}{k} p^k\\left(1-p\\right)^{n-k} \\tag{1.1} \\end{equation}\\] \\[\\begin{equation} f\\left(k\\right) = \\binom{n}{k} p^k\\left(1-p\\right)^{n-k} \\end{equation}\\] \\[\\begin{align} a_1&amp; =b_1+c_1\\\\ a_2&amp; =b_2+c_2-d_2+e_2\\\\ \\mathbb R \\end{align}\\] \\[\\begin{equation} y = mx+b \\end{equation}\\] Theorem 1.1 Here is my theorem.

"],["statements.html", "Chapter 2 Statements 2.1 Non-statements 2.2 What makes a good statement?", " Chapter 2 Statements A statement is a remark or declaration. Here are some examples: Life is pain. I am 19 years old. I like your hat. London is the capital of Great Britain. 2.1 Non-statements So what is not a statement? Ive listed four types of non-statements below. Can you think of any other types? 2.1.1 Fragments Fish. I am. Bro. These are incomplete sentences, and are therefore not statements. 2.1.2 Questions What is \\(2 \\cdot 2\\)? Are you going to eat that? What is this life if full of care? Anything that ends with a question mark is not a statement; its a question. 2.1.3 Implicit answers \\(162.5\\) Yes it is. The day after tomorrow. Anything that answers a question, without explicitly referencing the question, is not a statement. Or at least, not one that we can work with. 2.1.4 Exclamations Dang! Ura! Phew! 2.2 What makes a good statement? Not all statements are equally good! Some are better than others. Follow the rules below for high-quality statements: 2.2.1 All the words should be clear and understandable All the words in a statement should either already be understood by the reader, or should be easy to Google. Lets look at some examples: Bishkek is the capital of the Kyrgyz Republic. This is nice and clear. We know what the Kyrgyz Republic is, we know what Bishkek is, and we know what a capital is. The human foot is comprised of 26 bones. Again, this statement is nice and clear. We know what each term means. An atom of uranium has one more electron than an atom of protactinium. We might not understand every term here, but we could use Google to find out more. The candidate won the popular vote but lost the election. This isnt clear, and no matter how much Googling we do, we wont be able to clarify the details. We need to ask the author of the statement: Which election? Which year? Which candidate? I love you. On its own, this statement isnt clear enough. Who is speaking, and to whom? Once we understand that, we need to ask whether love is clearly defined? Are we talking about something from the soul? Something biological? Familiar love? Friendship? 1000 is a large number. Theres only one word here which is not clear: large. Its not clear how the author is defining large. Maybe the author could change the statement to compare it with something: 1000 is larger than 500. 1000 people died today in our country, the largest daily total since the global pandemic began. 1000 is the largest number for which the Romans had a symbol. In all three of these statements, the word ``large has now been given clear meaning. 2.2.2 No paradoxes! Paradoxes contradict themselves. These statements rely more on tricks of language: This statement is not clear. This statement is false. The statement below is not true. The statement above is true. Because paradoxes are built to contradict themselves, they arent much use to us. Therefore well avoid them in this course.1 Exercise 2.1 Can you find any other paradoxical statements? What makes them paradoxical? 2.2.3 Statements should stand on their own Dont you hate that feeling when you start watching a film but nothing makes sense because you didnt watch the previous films in the series?2 A good statement should stand on its own, and not rely on the reader knowing previous statements. If it does assume knowledge of previous statements, they should be referenced or restated, like including a plot synopsis for the previous movies! Now its your turn. Bring your answers to our next class. Going forward, all statements will be coloured yellow, Exercise 2.2 Take a look at the statements below. Are all the terms clear? Do you understand all the terms? If not, do you think you could find out their meaning on your own? Do any of the statements need more explanation by the author? It is hot today. It is hotter today than it was yesterday. The highest temperature on record, 54.4\\(^{\\circ}\\)C or 130\\(^{\\circ}\\)F, was measured on 16th August 2020 at the Death Valley National Park in California. The explosion in Beirut in August 2020 could have been avoided. 24 is a nice number. 28 is a perfect number. Two negatives make a positive. Aman has a twin sister. Ariana Grande was the most streamed artist of the year. On average it rains more in Wales than it does in Kyrgyzstan. Solution. 1. It is not clear what hot means. Definitions of hot will vary around the world and from person to person. 2. This is clearer than the previous statement, however we could benefit from knowing where this statement is talking about. Bishkek? New York? Night time? Day time? 3. This is pefectly clear. We know where and when the statement is talking about, that it is referring to a peak temperature, and that it is not claiming that this was indeed the highest temperature ever on Earth, merely that it is the highest on record. Exercise 2.3 Using the three rules given above, which of the following statements are good? What is wrong with the others? The cyrillic alphabet contains 33 letters. Gunnar Garfors has visited every country in the world. People find it harder to concentrate on one task than they used to. Mobile phones have gotten more powerful over time. Video games help people relax. The US is larger than China. The last word of this sentence is. This sentence contains four es. This sentence contains 3 1s, 1 2 and 2 3s. The longest word in this sentence is complementary. What have we learnt? We understand what isnt a statement, whats a bad statement and whats a good statement. We also understand In this course, we will only work with good, high-quality statements. Next, lets look at whether good statements are true or not. They are good for keeping our brains busy though! I had watched none of the previous Marvel movies before watching Avengers: Endgame. I understood nothing and had to spend an hour afterwards quizzing my boyfriend on the Tesseract, the Ancient One, and what Robert Downey Jr. was doing stranded in space. I think I got it. "],["truth-values.html", "Chapter 3 Truth values 3.1 What is the truth value of a statement? 3.2 Clearly defined truth values 3.3 Statements without clearly defined truth values 3.4 Unknown truth values", " Chapter 3 Truth values 3.1 What is the truth value of a statement? Simply, the truth value of a statement is whether the statement is true or false. The truth value of the statement Bishkek is the capital of the Kyrgyz Republic is true. The truth value of the statement Osh is the capital of the Kyrgyz Republic is false. Exercise 3.1 What are the truth values of the following statements? \\(4 + 4 = 9\\) \\(3 \\cdot 6 = 18\\) Ice melts above \\(0^{\\circ}\\)C on Earth. \\(11,118\\) is the largest number in existence. The Earth is closer to the Sun than Jupiter. \\(a^2+b^2=c^2\\), where \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c = 1\\). \\(a = b+c\\). \\(1000\\) is a large number. 3.2 Clearly defined truth values Look back up at Exercise 3.1. Did you notice how the first 6 statements all have clearly defined truth values: they are either true (b, c and e) or false (a, d and f). What do we mean when we say the statement has a clearly defined truth value? Completeness - The statement contains enough information for its truth value to be decided. Terms are clearly defined or easily researchable. Objectivity - The truth value is not based on personal opinion or experience. Mutual exclusivity - If a statement is true, it cant also be false. If a statement is false, it cant also be true. Universality - If the statement is true today, it will be true tomorrow, and it was true yesterday. Exercise 3.2 For this exercise, you should write: A statement which has a clearly defined truth value of true. A statement which has a clearly defined truth value of false. A statement which has a clearly defined truth value that only you know. 3.3 Statements without clearly defined truth values Look again at Exercise 3.1. Did you notice how statements g and h didnt have clearly defined truth values? Why not? Lets look at g: \\(a = b + c\\) This statement doesnt contain enough information for us to be able to decide on its truth value. It can be true, for example if \\(a = 5\\), \\(b = 2\\) and \\(c = 3\\). But it can also be false, for example if \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c = 1\\). We cant decide, as we know nothing about \\(a\\), \\(b\\), or \\(c\\). Next well look at h: \\(1000\\) is a large number. This statement doesnt have a clearly defined truth value because it depends on personal opinion. Younger members of your family might say the truth value of this statement is true, because they are used to using smaller numbers. However an economist or an astrophysicist or a paleontologist (or you) might disagree, because they are used to dealing with numbers much larger than 1000. Lets look at two more examples: \\(4x&gt;0\\) Why is the truth value of this statement not clearly defined? Its because there is not enough information. Its truth value depends entirely on the value of \\(x\\), about which we know nothing. If we choose \\(x\\) to be 10, this statement is true, but if we choose \\(x\\) to be \\(-5\\), the statement is false. Bishkek is a big city. Weve already said that good statements are clear and specific. The reason for this is so that we can decide their truth value. In this statement, big is a very vague term. The units of measurement arent clear. Is it referring to area, to the number of people in Bishkek, to the number of buildings, to the size of those buildings? Also, big compared to what? Compared to Karakol? Compared to Osh? Compared to Almaty? Compared to Seoul? Or maybe compared to 100 years ago? Again, its not clear. Exercise 3.3 The following statements do not have clearly defined truth values. Why not? This math problem is difficult. Damascus is an old city. The largest city in my country is also my capital city. The world is in a bad state right now. \\(3.14\\) \\(x\\) is positive. \\(ab &gt; cd\\) Tomorrow is Wednesday. \\(4\\) is an unlucky number. Exercise 3.4 Write a statement which does not have clearly defined truth value. For what reason(s) does your statement not have a clearly defined truth value? 3.4 Unknown truth values What if you dont know the truth value of a statement? Does that mean it is not clearly defined? Lets consider the following statement: Example 3.1 \\(29,999\\) is a prime number.3 You probably dont know whether this statement is true or false. I certainly didnt know when I wrote it! However, its clear that this statement will have a clearly defined truth value, even if we dont know what it is: Completeness - The statement contains enough information, and the terms are clear. Objectivity - The primeness of numbers is not a matter of personal opinion. Mutual exclusivity - This statement is either true or it is false: 29,999 cant be both prime and not prime. Universality - If 29,999 is prime today, it will be prime tomorrow, and it was prime yesterday. Heres another example: Example 3.2 Earth is the only planet in the entire universe with life. Completeness - The statement contains enough information, and the terms are clear (as long as life is clearly defined4). Objectivity - The existence (or not) of life on other planets wont be a personal opinion: it either exists or it doesnt. Mutual exclusivity - This statement is either true or it is false. Universality - This statement is universal to a point. For example, the truth value of this statement could change over time, for example if life appears on a planet sometime in the future. However, considering the huge amounts of time that is required for life to appear, for our purposes this statement has universality. Despite not knowing the truth value of this statement, it will have a clearly defined truth value. Either Earth is the only planet with life (statements truth value: true) or there are other planets with life somewhere in the universe (statements truth value: false). However, unlike Example 3.1, this statements truth value is less easy to find out. Googling ``is there life out there? isnt going to help, as the answer is not yet known, and might never be known. Careful! Just because we dont know the truth value of a statement, that doesnt mean it doesnt have one! Its also possible that a statement has a clearly defined truth value that we can or will never know. Exercise 3.5 Write a statement which does not have clearly defined truth value. For what reason(s) does your statement not have a clearly defined truth value? Exercise 3.6 Which of the following are important for a statements truth value to be clearly defined? The statement contains enough information. The statement is written in English. The statement is about mathematics. Any terms new to the reader are easy to look up using Google or in a book. The statement is objectively true or false, not personal opinion. The statement contains numbers. The statement is universally true or false, not just locally. The statement is short. All terms are clear. The statement is not a paradox. Someone else wrote the statement, not me. The statement is typed, not handwritten. Exercise 3.7 Which of the following statements will have clearly defined truth values? Which wont have clearly defined truth values? Why not? No UN member state has a flag which contains purple. SZA is taller than The Weeknd. People find me funnier than you. There is a largest number. \\(x &gt; 0\\). \\(|x|\\) is never negative. All odd numbers end with \\(1\\), \\(3\\), \\(5\\), \\(7\\) or \\(9\\). All even numbers end with \\(2\\), \\(4\\), \\(6\\), \\(8\\) or \\(0\\). \\(100\\) is prime. Poetry is difficult to understand. Earth is the only planet in the universe which contains life. All square numbers are even. There are no solutions to the equation \\(a^2 + b^2 = c^2\\). There are no solutions to the equation \\(a^3 + b^3 = c^3\\). All perfect numbers are even.5 Eating vegetables is good for peoples health. All men are created equal. It rained in Bishkek on New Years Day 2020. All people have black hair. Most people are good. Max is tall. The identity of the oldest person alive is known. \\(30\\mod 7 = 2\\). \\(29\\mod 4 = 3\\). Japanese is the hardest language for non-native speakers to learn. Japanese is difficult for non-native speakers to learn. What have we learnt? Weve learnt what it means to be a statement. Weve learnt what it means to be a good statement too. And weve learnt what it means for a good statement to have a clearly-defined truth value. In our next chapter, we define a new term Go googling if youre not sure what prime means! It is possible that people might disagree on what constitutes life, see https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/aug/06/lyfe-a-new-word-for-aliens-that-takes-a-leaf-out-of-life. However, as long as we agree on a definition of life, this statement will have a clearly defined truth value. See http://mathforum.org/library/drmath/view/51526.html. "],["mathematical-statements.html", "Chapter 4 Mathematical statements 4.1 Definition 4.2 Mathematical statements dont need to be about mathematics! 4.3 Statements containing mathematics arent necessarily mathematical!", " Chapter 4 Mathematical statements 4.1 Definition Quite simply, if a statement is good (clear and non-paradoxical) and has a clearly-defined truth value (even if you dont know what that truth value is), it is described as a mathematical statement. Statements which fail to qualify as mathematical statements are called non-mathematical statements. 4.2 Mathematical statements dont need to be about mathematics! Before we move on, we need to address a really important point. When we say something is a mathematical statement, it does not have to be about mathematics!! Lets look at some examples of mathematical and non-mathematical statements: Example 4.1 Bishkek is the capital of the Kyrgyz Republic. This is a mathematical statement, even though its not talking about mathematics! It is mathematical because it is clear, all terms are defined, and it has a clearly-defined truth value (true). Example 4.2 Malta is the largest country in the world This is also a mathematical statement, despite not being about mathematics. It is clear, all terms are defined, and it has a clearly-defined truth value (false). Example 4.3 \\(356\\) and \\(989\\) have no common divisors. This is a mathematical statement - it will have a clearly-defined truth value. Example 4.4 There is a smallest elementary particle, one that cant be divided into smaller particles. This is a mathematical statement. All terms are easy to Google, and the statement will have a clearly-defined truth value (though its currently unknown6). Example 4.5 Pears are the best fruit. This is not a mathematical statement because it is an opinion. Example 4.6 \\(8\\) is better than \\(14\\). This statement is not mathematical because it is an opinion, and because better is not defined, and therefore will not have a clearly-defined truth value. Example 4.7 The Earth is big. This is also not mathematical because it is vague and therefore will not have a clearly-defined truth value. 4.3 Statements containing mathematics arent necessarily mathematical! We should also be clear on another point: Just because a statement contains mathematics, that doesnt mean its mathematical! The statement 8 is a better number than 14 might be about numbers, but its not mathematical because it doesnt have a clearly-defined truth value. Equally, the statement \\(ab = cd\\) is definitely mathematical in its content, but it is not classified a mathematical statement because it doesnt contain enough information to decide on its truth value. Careful! Mathematical statements dont have to be about mathematics. They just have to be good, clear statements with a clearly-defined (though possibly unknown) truth value. We use the word mathematical here to describe the nature of the statement, rather than its content. Exercise 4.1 For this exercise, you should write: A mathematical statement that is not about mathematics. A mathematical statement that is about mathematics. A non-mathematical statement that is about mathematics. A non-mathematical statement that is not about mathematics. Exercise 4.2 Do you know the truth values of the two mathematical statements you wrote in the previous question? If not, do you think you could find out? Exercise 4.3 Look back at the twenty-six statements in Exercise 3.7. How many of them are mathematical statements? How many are non-mathematical statements? Exercise 4.4 Of those statements in Exercise 3.7 which are mathematical statements: Which of them do you know are true? Which do you know are false? Which dont you know the truth value of but you think someone in the world does? Do you think there are any to which no one in the world knows the answer to? Exercise 4.5 Do you think there are mathematical statements to which no one can ever know the answer? Can you think of any? Exercise 4.6 Below are four more statements. Repeat Exercises 4.3 and 4.4 for these statements. There are infinitely many square numbers. There are infinitely many prime numbers.7 There are infinitely many perfect numbers. There is no set8 whose cardinality9 is strictly between that of the integers10 and the real numbers11. What have we learnt? Weve learnt that the statement A is the eighth letter of the Latin alphabet is a mathematical statement, but \\(a^2 + b^2 = c^2\\) is not, because it doesnt have a clearly-defined truth value! Weve learnt to consider the nature of the statement, not its subject, when deciding if it is mathematical or not. See https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZorRPAD32i4 for what might be smaller than leptons and quarks, and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ehHoOYqAT\\_U for a nice introduction to elementary particles. Watch from 12:30 in this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OihQPf4mJH4. A set is a collection of items. Cardinality tells you the number of items in a set. Integers are the whole numbers: -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3 Real number include both whole and non-whole numbers. "],["axioms.html", "Chapter 5 Axioms 5.1 What makes a mathematical statement an axiom? 5.2 What makes an axiom a definition?", " Chapter 5 Axioms Now that we fully understand what makes a statement mathematical, we should discuss axioms. 5.1 What makes a mathematical statement an axiom? Axioms are mathematical statements which are true, and are self-evidently so. Basically, they are things so obviously true or so universally accepted, that when you read them, you say to yourself, Duh, of course!12. Axioms should be so obvious, that when asked to prove them, you end up scratching your head and shouting CMON, IT JUST IS TRUE!!!!. Axioms are the building blocks of mathematics. There is no complete list of them all, as we can always add more of them to the list. On our Miro board, I have created a space called **Our Axioms} where well store all the axioms which we may use in this course. Tell me if you find a statement which you believe is an axiom but isnt there. Careful! What you might consider to be an axiom (something so obviously true that no proof is needed), someone else might believe is not self-evident and that a proof is needed. Thats fineif challenged to prove something that you believe is an axiom, rise to that challenge! Rules of axioms: These describe a property of a mathematical object or operation. The property is not necessarily unique to the mathematical object, for example \\(ab = ba\\) for multiplication is also true of addition: \\(a+b=b+a\\), and There are infinitely many ways to cut a circle into two equal halves is also true for spheres: There are infinitely many ways to cut a spheres into two equal halves Axioms are mathematical statements which are TRUE, elementary and universally accepted, but which dont have proofs (because they are so fundamental). Axioms should never cover more than one property of an object or operation. Axioms should not be able to be derived from other axioms. Here are a few axioms about algebra. Note that \\(a, b, c\\) and \\(d\\) can be any numbers.13 If \\(a = c\\) then \\(c = a\\). If \\(a = c\\) and \\(b = c\\), then \\(a = b\\). If \\(a = b\\) and \\(b = c\\), then \\(a = c\\). If \\(a = b\\) and \\(c = d\\), then \\(a + c = b + d\\). \\(a \\cdot b = b \\cdot a\\). If \\(a = b\\) and \\(c = d\\), then \\(ac = bd\\). Here are a few axioms about geometry:14 If you have two points, you can draw a straight line which connects them. If you have two points, you can always draw a circle with one of the points at the circles centre and the other on its edge. There are infinitely many ways to cut a circle into two equal halves. A straight line can be extended in either direction forever. Three points can be arranged in such a way that they dont all lie on the same straight line. Four points can be arranged in such a way that they dont all lie on the same flat plane. Note: All of the axioms above can be written in even briefer terms, though I havent done so, in order to ensure clarity. Exercise 5.1 Illustrate each of the six algebraic axioms above with an example. The first 3 are going to seem *really} obvious! Exercise 5.2 Illustrate each of the six geometric axioms above with an example. Exercise 5.3 Before our next class, I want you to think of one algebraic and one geometric statement which you believe are so obviously true that they are in fact axioms. Come to Tuesdays class ready to share your proposed axioms. Those which we all agree are axiomatic will be added to Our Axioms on Miro. Note that axioms should be nicely short and simple. 5.2 What makes an axiom a definition? Be careful! Some statements which seem really obvious and fundamental are actually so obvious and fundamental that they are definitions, not axioms. Whats the difference between an axiom and a definition? Well, if you ever bought a Mathematics Dictionary, you would find definitions inside, not axioms. Rules for definitions: These uniquely describe a mathematical object or operation Definitions answer the question, What is a ?, for example What is a square or What is an even number? or What is multiplication? Definitions cant be proved, they are just accepted. They allow us to all agree on key terms in mathematics. Below are some statements which are definitions, not axioms. Each definitions subject is in bold. A square number (or perfect square) is the square of a whole number. Whole numbers (or integers) are numbers with digits only to the left of the decimal point. Non-whole numbers are numbers which have value to the right of the decimal point (and possibly to the left too). Two whole numbers \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are consecutive if either \\(b = a + 1\\) or \\(a = b + 1\\). \\(a\\) divides \\(b\\) if \\(b \\div a\\) leaves no remainder. Even numbers are whole numbers which can be written in the form \\(2n\\), where \\(n\\) is a whole number. Odd numbers are whole numbers which cannot be written in the form \\(2n\\), where \\(n\\) is a whole number.15 The absolute (or modulus) of a negative number is the positive version of that number. A point has no length, width or height. A line has length but no width or height. Exercise 5.4 Below is an axiom, a definition and a (quite obvious) statement. Which is which? Be careful - just because something seems obvious to you, that doesnt mean its self-evidently true and an axiom of mathematics. The sum of the digits of any number divisible by \\(9\\) is itself divisible by \\(9\\). The product of two negative numbers is positive. For two positive numbers \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(a\\) is larger that \\(b\\) if \\(a - b &gt; 0\\). Exercise 5.5 Come up with definitions of the following terms. Try to be concise, but sufficiently clear. A rectangle. A square. A straight line. A circle. A 3D shape. A rational number. Consecutive even numbers. Consecutive odd numbers. MAX(\\(a, b, c, d\\)). MIN(\\(a, b, c, d\\)). An acute angle. A circles circumference. A tangent to a circle. The sum of two numbers. The difference of two numbers. The product of two numbers. The ratio of two numbers. A cube number (or perfect cube).16 A triangle. A cuboid. Adjacent sides of a triangle. A multiple of a number. An octagon. Two perpendicular lines. A prime number. The proper divisors (or proper factors) of a whole number. Exercise 5.6 Use the following questions to check your understanding of some key definitions. Is zero even? Is a square a rectangle? Does \\(12\\) have five or six divisors? How many proper divisors does \\(25\\) have? If a triangle is a \\(3\\)-gon, a pentagon is a \\(5\\)-gon, and an octagon is an \\(8\\)-gon, what is a \\(4\\)-gon? Whats a \\(6\\)-gon? Whats a \\(2\\)-gon? Is \\(87\\) prime? How many multiples of \\(7\\) are two-digit numbers? How many pairs of adjacent sides does a triangle have? How many of the following are not lengths? circumference of a circle perimeter of a rectangle distance between two points width of a cuboid height of a cylinder Solution. 17 A square number (or perfect square) is the square of a whole number. Whole numbers (or integers) are numbers with digits only to the left of the decimal point. Non-whole numbers are numbers which have value to the right of the decimal point (and possibly to the left too). Two whole numbers a and b are consecutive if either \\(b = a + 1\\) or \\(a = b + 1\\). \\(a\\) divides \\(b\\) if \\(b ÷ a\\) leaves no remainder. Even numbers are whole numbers which can be written in the form \\(2n\\), where \\(n\\) is a whole number. Odd numbers are whole numbers which cannot be written in the form \\(2n\\), where \\(n\\) is a whole number. The absolute (or modulus) of a negativenumber is the positive version of that num-ber. A point has no length, width or height. A line has length but no width or height. A rectangle: a shape with four straight sides and four right angles A straight line: a line with unchanging slope A circle: a shape representing all the points equidistant from a single point A 3D shape: a shape with width, length and height A rational number: a number that be expressed at the ratio of two integers Consecutive even numbers: If a is an even number \\(2n\\), and \\(b = a+2\\), then \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are consecutive even numbers. Consecutive odd numbers: If \\(a\\) is an odd number \\(2n + 1\\), and \\(b = a + 2\\), then \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are consecutive odd numbers. MAX( ): Returns the largest of a set of numbers. MIN( ): Returns the smallest of a set of numbers. An acute angle: An angle measuring between \\(0\\) and \\(90\\) degrees. A circles circumference: The distant around the edge of a circle. A tangent to a circle: A straight line which intercepts a circle only once. The sum of two numbers: For two numbers \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), their sum is \\(a + b\\). The difference of two numbers: For two numbers \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), their difference is \\(a - b\\). The product of two numbers: For two numbers \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), their product is \\(a \\cdot b\\). The ratio of two numbers: For two numbers \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), their ratio is \\(a / b\\). A cube number (or perfect cube): A perfect cube is the cube of an integer. A triangle: A three-sided 2D shape. A cuboid: A 3D shape which has six rectangular faces at right angles to each other. Adjacent sides of a triangle: Two sides which meet at a common point. A multiple of a number: The number multiplied by any integer. An octagon: An eight-sided 2D shape. Two perpendicular lines: Two straight lines which meet at a right-angle. A prime number: An integer whose only two unique divisors are \\(1\\) and itself. The proper divisors (or proper factors) of a whole number: Integers which divide into another integer, excluding the number itself. What have we learnt? Axioms are special kinds of mathematical statements; they are ones which are self-evidently true. They are the building blocks of mathematics. Weve also learnt that really fundamental axioms are called definitions. They are how we are sure you, your fellow mathematicians and your reader all understand what youre talking about!18 https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/duh See https://www.aaamath.com/ac11.htm.

Alternatively: Odd numbers are whole numbers which can be written in the form \\(2n + 1\\), where \\(n\\) is a whole number. Unlike perfect squares, perfect cubes do not have a small number of possibilities for the last two digits. Except for cubes divisible by \\(5\\), where only \\(25\\), \\(75\\) and \\(00\\) are allowed.
