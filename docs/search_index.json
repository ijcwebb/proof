Its lovely to have you here! 1.1 About this course This book accompanies the course Reason and Argue Better: Logic in Proof and Argument, which was written between 2018-2019 and has been taught every semester since. This is the third semester that this course has been taught online or partly online. The course has been adapted for online teaching, with some elements simplified and others expanded. Completing this course online offers some challenges, but also opportunities for things not possible when offline. 1.2 About this book This book contains the material we will study as well as exercises (see the next section) and links for further reading. Most weeks I will assign you a chapter to read, and you should complete both the reading and the exercises within the chapter before our next class. This textbook may be updated during the course. Therefore you are advised to access the book at the link at https://ijcwebb.github.io/proof, rather than printing or downloading it. Also, even though you can read ahead of the set chapter, you are advised that later chapters might change as the course procedes. Part I of this book (chapters 2-5) covers the terminology surrounding mathematical proof, part II (chapters 6-9) covers the basics of proof, and chapters 10-16 in part III each cover a different method of proof. Chapter 17 covers mathematical completeness. 1.3 How to use this book When completing the weeks reading, you will encounter some exercises. I will indicate which of these you should attempt. Exercise 1.1 Regular exercises look like this with subparts like this. Solution. Solutions might be included underneath exercises, in which case you should aim to complete the exercise before checking the solution. If the solution is not included, then we will probably discuss it in class. Exercise 1.2 Extension exercises look like this. These are exercises that require a little more thought. Solutions wont be given in the book for these exercises, but we may discuss these in class. You can also book one-to-one consultations to discuss. There are a couple of other coloured boxes used in this book: Careful! This is where I alert you to mistakes commonly made by students in this course. Read these warnings carefully to avoid these mistakes yourself. What weve learnt These boxes are found at the end of each chapter, and recap the main things we have covered in the chapter. You can view these as key takeaways from the chapter. These often set us up for the next chapter too. Thats it. Youre ready to begin! "],["statements.html", "Chapter 2 Statements 2.1 Non-statements 2.2 What makes a good statement?", " Chapter 2 Statements A statement is a remark or declaration. Here are some examples: Life is pain. I am 19 years old. I like your hat. London is the capital of Great Britain. 2.1 Non-statements So what is not a statement? Ive listed four types of non-statements below. Can you think of any other types? 2.1.1 Fragments Fish. I am. Bro. These are incomplete sentences, and are therefore not statements. 2.1.2 Questions What is \\(2 \\cdot 2\\)? Are you going to eat that? What is this life if full of care? Anything that ends with a question mark is not a statement; its a question. 2.1.3 Implicit answers \\(162.5\\) Yes it is. The day after tomorrow. Anything that answers a question, without explicitly referencing the question, is not a statement. Or at least, not one that we can work with. 2.1.4 Exclamations Dang! Ura! Phew! 2.2 What makes a good statement? Not all statements are equally good! Some are better than others. Follow the rules below for high-quality statements: 2.2.1 All the words should be clear and understandable All the words in a statement should either already be understood by the reader, or should be easy to Google. Lets look at some examples: Bishkek is the capital of the Kyrgyz Republic. This is nice and clear. We know what the Kyrgyz Republic is, we know what Bishkek is, and we know what a capital is. The human foot is comprised of 26 bones. Again, this statement is nice and clear. We know what each term means. An atom of uranium has one more electron than an atom of protactinium. We might not understand every term here, but we could use Google to find out more. The candidate won the popular vote but lost the election. This isnt clear, and no matter how much Googling we do, we wont be able to clarify the details. We need to ask the author of the statement: Which election? Which year? Which candidate? I love you. On its own, this statement isnt clear enough. Who is speaking, and to whom? Once we understand that, we need to ask whether love is clearly defined? Are we talking about something from the soul? Something biological? Familiar love? Friendship? 1000 is a large number. Theres only one word here which is not clear: large. Its not clear how the author is defining large. Maybe the author could change the statement to compare it with something: 1000 is larger than 500. 1000 people died today in our country, the largest daily total since the global pandemic began. 1000 is the largest number for which the Romans had a symbol. In all three of these statements, the word ``large has now been given clear meaning. 2.2.2 No paradoxes! Paradoxes contradict themselves. These statements rely more on tricks of language: This statement is not clear. This statement is false. The statement below is not true. The statement above is true. Because paradoxes are built to contradict themselves, they arent much use to us. Therefore well avoid them in this course.1 Exercise 2.1 Can you find any other paradoxical statements? What makes them paradoxical? 2.2.3 Statements should stand on their own Dont you hate that feeling when you start watching a film but nothing makes sense because you didnt watch the previous films in the series?2 A good statement should stand on its own, and not rely on the reader knowing previous statements. If it does assume knowledge of previous statements, they should be referenced or restated, like including a plot synopsis for the previous movies! Now its your turn. Bring your answers to our next class. Exercise 2.2 Take a look at the statements below. Are all the terms clear? Do you understand all the terms? If not, do you think you could find out their meaning on your own? Do any of the statements need more explanation by the author? It is hot today. It is hotter today than it was yesterday. The highest temperature on record, 54.4\\(^{\\circ}\\)C or 130\\(^{\\circ}\\)F, was measured on 16th August 2020 at the Death Valley National Park in California. The explosion in Beirut in August 2020 could have been avoided. 24 is a nice number. 28 is a perfect number. Two negatives make a positive. Aman has a twin sister. Ariana Grande was the most streamed artist of the year. On average it rains more in Wales than it does in Kyrgyzstan. Solution. Here are a few solutions to the above exercise. It is not clear what hot means. Definitions of hot will vary around the world and from person to person. This is clearer than the previous statement, however we could benefit from knowing where this statement is talking about. Bishkek? New York? Night time? Day time? This is pefectly clear. We know where and when the statement is talking about, that it is referring to a peak temperature, and that it is not claiming that this was indeed the highest temperature ever on Earth, merely that it is the highest on record. Exercise 2.3 Using the three rules given above, which of the following statements are good? What is wrong with the others? The cyrillic alphabet contains 33 letters. Gunnar Garfors has visited every country in the world. People find it harder to concentrate on one task than they used to. Mobile phones have gotten more powerful over time. Video games help people relax. The US is larger than China. The last word of this sentence is. This sentence contains four es. This sentence contains 3 1s, 1 2 and 2 3s. The longest word in this sentence is complementary. What have we learnt? We understand what isnt a statement, whats a bad statement and whats a good statement. We also understand In this course, we will only work with good, high-quality statements. Next, lets look at whether good statements are true or not. They are good for keeping our brains busy though! I had watched none of the previous Marvel movies before watching Avengers: Endgame. I understood nothing and had to spend an hour afterwards quizzing my boyfriend on the Tesseract, the Ancient One, and what Robert Downey Jr. was doing stranded in space. I think I got it. "],["truth-values.html", "Chapter 3 Truth values 3.1 What is the truth value of a statement? 3.2 Clearly defined truth values 3.3 Statements without clearly defined truth values 3.4 Unknown truth values", " Chapter 3 Truth values 3.1 What is the truth value of a statement? Simply, the truth value of a statement is whether the statement is true or false. The truth value of the statement Bishkek is the capital of the Kyrgyz Republic is true. The truth value of the statement Osh is the capital of the Kyrgyz Republic is false. Exercise 3.1 What are the truth values of the following statements? \\(4 + 4 = 9\\) \\(3 \\cdot 6 = 18\\) Ice melts above \\(0^{\\circ}\\)C on Earth. \\(11,118\\) is the largest number in existence. The Earth is closer to the Sun than Jupiter. \\(a^2+b^2=c^2\\), where \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c = 1\\). \\(a = b+c\\). \\(1000\\) is a large number. 3.2 Clearly defined truth values Look back up at Exercise 3.1. Did you notice how the first 6 statements all have clearly defined truth values: they are either true (b, c and e) or false (a, d and f). What do we mean when we say the statement has a clearly defined truth value? Completeness - The statement contains enough information for its truth value to be decided. Terms are clearly defined or easily researchable. Objectivity - The truth value is not based on personal opinion or experience. Mutual exclusivity - If a statement is true, it cant also be false. If a statement is false, it cant also be true. Universality - If the statement is true today, it will be true tomorrow, and it was true yesterday. Exercise 3.2 For this exercise, you should write: A statement which has a clearly defined truth value of true. A statement which has a clearly defined truth value of false. A statement which has a clearly defined truth value that only you know. 3.3 Statements without clearly defined truth values Look again at Exercise 3.1. Did you notice how statements g and h didnt have clearly defined truth values? Why not? Lets look at g: \\(a = b + c\\) This statement doesnt contain enough information for us to be able to decide on its truth value. It can be true, for example if \\(a = 5\\), \\(b = 2\\) and \\(c = 3\\). But it can also be false, for example if \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c = 1\\). We cant decide, as we know nothing about \\(a\\), \\(b\\), or \\(c\\). Next well look at h: \\(1000\\) is a large number. This statement doesnt have a clearly defined truth value because it depends on personal opinion. Younger members of your family might say the truth value of this statement is true, because they are used to using smaller numbers. However an economist or an astrophysicist or a paleontologist (or you) might disagree, because they are used to dealing with numbers much larger than 1000. Lets look at two more examples: \\(4x&gt;0\\) Why is the truth value of this statement not clearly defined? Its because there is not enough information. Its truth value depends entirely on the value of \\(x\\), about which we know nothing. If we choose \\(x\\) to be 10, this statement is true, but if we choose \\(x\\) to be \\(-5\\), the statement is false. Bishkek is a big city. Weve already said that good statements are clear and specific. The reason for this is so that we can decide their truth value. In this statement, big is a very vague term. The units of measurement arent clear. Is it referring to area, to the number of people in Bishkek, to the number of buildings, to the size of those buildings? Also, big compared to what? Compared to Karakol? Compared to Osh? Compared to Almaty? Compared to Seoul? Or maybe compared to 100 years ago? Again, its not clear. Exercise 3.3 The following statements do not have clearly defined truth values. Why not? This math problem is difficult. Damascus is an old city. The largest city in my country is also my capital city. The world is in a bad state right now. \\(3.14\\) \\(x\\) is positive. \\(ab &gt; cd\\) Tomorrow is Wednesday. \\(4\\) is an unlucky number. Exercise 3.4 Write a statement which does not have clearly defined truth value. For what reason(s) does your statement not have a clearly defined truth value? 3.4 Unknown truth values What if you dont know the truth value of a statement? Does that mean it is not clearly defined? Lets consider the following statement: Example 3.1 \\(29,999\\) is a prime number.3 You probably dont know whether this statement is true or false. I certainly didnt know when I wrote it! However, its clear that this statement will have a clearly defined truth value, even if we dont know what it is: Completeness - The statement contains enough information, and the terms are clear. Objectivity - The primeness of numbers is not a matter of personal opinion. Mutual exclusivity - This statement is either true or it is false: 29,999 cant be both prime and not prime. Universality - If 29,999 is prime today, it will be prime tomorrow, and it was prime yesterday. Heres another example: Example 3.2 Earth is the only planet in the entire universe with life. Completeness - The statement contains enough information, and the terms are clear (as long as life is clearly defined4). Objectivity - The existence (or not) of life on other planets wont be a personal opinion: it either exists or it doesnt. Mutual exclusivity - This statement is either true or it is false. Universality - This statement is universal to a point. For example, the truth value of this statement could change over time, for example if life appears on a planet sometime in the future. However, considering the huge amounts of time that is required for life to appear, for our purposes this statement has universality. Despite not knowing the truth value of this statement, it will have a clearly defined truth value. Either Earth is the only planet with life (statements truth value: true) or there are other planets with life somewhere in the universe (statements truth value: false). However, unlike Example 3.1, this statements truth value is less easy to find out. Googling ``is there life out there? isnt going to help, as the answer is not yet known, and might never be known. Careful! Just because we dont know the truth value of a statement, that doesnt mean it doesnt have one! Its also possible that a statement has a clearly defined truth value that we can or will never know. Exercise 3.5 Write a statement which does not have clearly defined truth value. For what reason(s) does your statement not have a clearly defined truth value? Exercise 3.6 Which of the following are important for a statements truth value to be clearly defined? The statement contains enough information. The statement is written in English. The statement is about mathematics. Any terms new to the reader are easy to look up using Google or in a book. The statement is objectively true or false, not personal opinion. The statement contains numbers. The statement is universally true or false, not just locally. The statement is short. All terms are clear. The statement is not a paradox. Someone else wrote the statement, not me. The statement is typed, not handwritten. Exercise 3.7 Which of the following statements will have clearly defined truth values? Which wont have clearly defined truth values? Why not? No UN member state has a flag which contains purple. SZA is taller than The Weeknd. People find me funnier than you. There is a largest number. \\(x &gt; 0\\). \\(|x|\\) is never negative. All odd numbers end with \\(1\\), \\(3\\), \\(5\\), \\(7\\) or \\(9\\). All even numbers end with \\(2\\), \\(4\\), \\(6\\), \\(8\\) or \\(0\\). \\(100\\) is prime. Poetry is difficult to understand. Earth is the only planet in the universe which contains life. All square numbers are even. There are no solutions to the equation \\(a^2 + b^2 = c^2\\). There are no solutions to the equation \\(a^3 + b^3 = c^3\\). All perfect numbers are even.5 Eating vegetables is good for peoples health. All men are created equal. It rained in Bishkek on New Years Day 2020. All people have black hair. Most people are good. Max is tall. The identity of the oldest person alive is known. \\(30\\mod 7 = 2\\). \\(29\\mod 4 = 3\\). Japanese is the hardest language for non-native speakers to learn. Japanese is difficult for non-native speakers to learn. What have we learnt? Weve learnt what it means to be a statement. Weve learnt what it means to be a good statement too. And weve learnt what it means for a good statement to have a clearly-defined truth value. In our next chapter, we define a new term Go googling if youre not sure what prime means! It is possible that people might disagree on what constitutes life, see https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/aug/06/lyfe-a-new-word-for-aliens-that-takes-a-leaf-out-of-life. However, as long as we agree on a definition of life, this statement will have a clearly defined truth value. See http://mathforum.org/library/drmath/view/51526.html. "],["mathematical-statements.html", "Chapter 4 Mathematical statements 4.1 Definition 4.2 Mathematical statements dont need to be about mathematics! 4.3 Statements containing mathematics arent necessarily mathematical!", " Chapter 4 Mathematical statements 4.1 Definition Quite simply, if a statement is good (clear and non-paradoxical) and has a clearly-defined truth value (even if you dont know what that truth value is), it is described as a mathematical statement. Statements which fail to qualify as mathematical statements are called non-mathematical statements. 4.2 Mathematical statements dont need to be about mathematics! Before we move on, we need to address a really important point. When we say something is a mathematical statement, it does not have to be about mathematics!! Lets look at some examples of mathematical and non-mathematical statements: Example 4.1 Bishkek is the capital of the Kyrgyz Republic. This is a mathematical statement, even though its not talking about mathematics! It is mathematical because it is clear, all terms are defined, and it has a clearly-defined truth value (true). Example 4.2 Malta is the largest country in the world This is also a mathematical statement, despite not being about mathematics. It is clear, all terms are defined, and it has a clearly-defined truth value (false). Example 4.3 \\(356\\) and \\(989\\) have no common divisors. This is a mathematical statement - it will have a clearly-defined truth value. Example 4.4 There is a smallest elementary particle, one that cant be divided into smaller particles. This is a mathematical statement. All terms are easy to Google, and the statement will have a clearly-defined truth value (though its currently unknown6). Example 4.5 Pears are the best fruit. This is not a mathematical statement because it is an opinion. Example 4.6 \\(8\\) is better than \\(14\\). This statement is not mathematical because it is an opinion, and because better is not defined, and therefore will not have a clearly-defined truth value. Example 4.7 The Earth is big. This is also not mathematical because it is vague and therefore will not have a clearly-defined truth value. 4.3 Statements containing mathematics arent necessarily mathematical! We should also be clear on another point: Just because a statement contains mathematics, that doesnt mean its mathematical! The statement 8 is a better number than 14 might be about numbers, but its not mathematical because it doesnt have a clearly-defined truth value. Equally, the statement \\(ab = cd\\) is definitely mathematical in its content, but it is not classified a mathematical statement because it doesnt contain enough information to decide on its truth value. Careful! Mathematical statements dont have to be about mathematics. They just have to be good, clear statements with a clearly-defined (though possibly unknown) truth value. We use the word mathematical here to describe the nature of the statement, rather than its content. Exercise 4.1 For this exercise, you should write: A mathematical statement that is not about mathematics. A mathematical statement that is about mathematics. A non-mathematical statement that is about mathematics. A non-mathematical statement that is not about mathematics. Exercise 4.2 Do you know the truth values of the two mathematical statements you wrote in the previous question? If not, do you think you could find out? Exercise 4.3 Look back at the twenty-six statements in Exercise 3.7. How many of them are mathematical statements? How many are non-mathematical statements? Exercise 4.4 Of those statements in Exercise 3.7 which are mathematical statements: Which of them do you know are true? Which do you know are false? Which dont you know the truth value of but you think someone in the world does? Do you think there are any to which no one in the world knows the answer to? Exercise 4.5 Do you think there are mathematical statements to which no one can ever know the answer? Can you think of any? Exercise 4.6 Below are four more statements. Repeat Exercises 4.3 and 4.4 for these statements. There are infinitely many square numbers. There are infinitely many prime numbers.7 There are infinitely many perfect numbers. There is no set8 whose cardinality9 is strictly between that of the integers10 and the real numbers11. What have we learnt? Weve learnt that the statement A is the eighth letter of the Latin alphabet is a mathematical statement, but \\(a^2 + b^2 = c^2\\) is not, because it doesnt have a clearly-defined truth value! Weve learnt to consider the nature of the statement, not its subject, when deciding if it is mathematical or not. See https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZorRPAD32i4 for what might be smaller than leptons and quarks, and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ehHoOYqAT\\_U for a nice introduction to elementary particles. Watch from 12:30 in this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OihQPf4mJH4. A set is a collection of items. Cardinality tells you the number of items in a set. Integers are the whole numbers: -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3 Real number include both whole and non-whole numbers. "],["axioms.html", "Chapter 5 Axioms 5.1 What makes a mathematical statement an axiom? 5.2 What makes an axiom a definition?", " Chapter 5 Axioms Now that we fully understand what makes a statement mathematical, we should discuss axioms. 5.1 What makes a mathematical statement an axiom? Axioms are mathematical statements which are true, and are self-evidently so. Basically, they are things so obviously true or so universally accepted, that when you read them, you say to yourself, Duh, of course!12. Axioms should be so obvious, that when asked to prove them, you end up scratching your head and shouting CMON, IT JUST IS TRUE!!!! Axioms are the building blocks of mathematics. There is no complete list of them all, as we can always add more of them to the list. On our Miro board, I have created a space called **Our Axioms} where well store all the axioms which we may use in this course. Tell me if you find a statement which you believe is an axiom but isnt there. Careful! What you might consider to be an axiom (something so obviously true that no proof is needed), someone else might believe is not self-evident and that a proof is needed. Thats fineif challenged to prove something that you believe is an axiom, rise to that challenge! Rules of axioms: These describe a property of a mathematical object or operation. The property is not necessarily unique to the mathematical object, for example \\(ab = ba\\) for multiplication is also true of addition: \\(a+b=b+a\\), and There are infinitely many ways to cut a circle into two equal halves is also true for spheres: There are infinitely many ways to cut a spheres into two equal halves Axioms are mathematical statements which are TRUE, elementary and universally accepted, but which dont have proofs (because they are so fundamental). Axioms should never cover more than one property of an object or operation. Axioms should not be able to be derived from other axioms. Here are a few axioms about algebra. Note that \\(a, b, c\\) and \\(d\\) can be any numbers.13 If \\(a = c\\) then \\(c = a\\). If \\(a = c\\) and \\(b = c\\), then \\(a = b\\). If \\(a = b\\) and \\(b = c\\), then \\(a = c\\). If \\(a = b\\) and \\(c = d\\), then \\(a + c = b + d\\). \\(a \\cdot b = b \\cdot a\\). If \\(a = b\\) and \\(c = d\\), then \\(ac = bd\\). Here are a few axioms about geometry:14 If you have two points, you can draw a straight line which connects them. If you have two points, you can always draw a circle with one of the points at the circles centre and the other on its edge. There are infinitely many ways to cut a circle into two equal halves. A straight line can be extended in either direction forever. Three points can be arranged in such a way that they dont all lie on the same straight line. Four points can be arranged in such a way that they dont all lie on the same flat plane. Note: All of the axioms above can be written in even briefer terms, though I havent done so, in order to ensure clarity. Exercise 5.1 Illustrate each of the six algebraic axioms above with an example. The first 3 are going to seem *really} obvious! Exercise 5.2 Illustrate each of the six geometric axioms above with an example. Exercise 5.3 Before our next class, I want you to think of one algebraic and one geometric statement which you believe are so obviously true that they are in fact axioms. Come to Tuesdays class ready to share your proposed axioms. Those which we all agree are axiomatic will be added to Our Axioms on Miro. Note that axioms should be nicely short and simple. 5.2 What makes an axiom a definition? Be careful! Some statements which seem really obvious and fundamental are actually so obvious and fundamental that they are definitions, not axioms. Whats the difference between an axiom and a definition? Well, if you ever bought a Mathematics Dictionary, you would find definitions inside, not axioms. Rules for definitions: These uniquely describe a mathematical object or operation Definitions answer the question, What is a ? for example What is a square or What is an even number? or What is multiplication? Definitions cant be proved, they are just accepted. They allow us to all agree on key terms in mathematics. Below are some statements which are definitions, not axioms. Each definitions subject is in bold. A square number (or perfect square) is the square of a whole number. Whole numbers (or integers) are numbers with digits only to the left of the decimal point. Non-whole numbers are numbers which have value to the right of the decimal point (and possibly to the left too). Two whole numbers \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are consecutive if either \\(b = a + 1\\) or \\(a = b + 1\\). \\(a\\) divides \\(b\\) if \\(b \\div a\\) leaves no remainder. Even numbers are whole numbers which can be written in the form \\(2n\\), where \\(n\\) is a whole number. Odd numbers are whole numbers which cannot be written in the form \\(2n\\), where \\(n\\) is a whole number.15 The absolute (or modulus) of a negative number is the positive version of that number. A point has no length, width or height. A line has length but no width or height. Exercise 5.4 Below is an axiom, a definition and a (quite obvious) statement. Which is which? Be careful - just because something seems obvious to you, that doesnt mean its self-evidently true and an axiom of mathematics. The sum of the digits of any number divisible by \\(9\\) is itself divisible by \\(9\\). The product of two negative numbers is positive. For two positive numbers \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(a\\) is larger that \\(b\\) if \\(a - b &gt; 0\\). Exercise 5.5 Come up with definitions of the following terms. Try to be concise, but sufficiently clear. A rectangle. A square. A straight line. A circle. A 3D shape. A rational number. Consecutive even numbers. Consecutive odd numbers. MAX(\\(a, b, c, d\\)). MIN(\\(a, b, c, d\\)). An acute angle. A circles circumference. A tangent to a circle. The sum of two numbers. The difference of two numbers. The product of two numbers. The ratio of two numbers. A cube number (or perfect cube).16 A triangle. A cuboid. Adjacent sides of a triangle. A multiple of a number. An octagon. Two perpendicular lines. A prime number. The proper divisors (or proper factors) of a whole number. Exercise 5.6 Use the following questions to check your understanding of some key definitions. Is zero even? Is a square a rectangle? Does \\(12\\) have five or six divisors? How many proper divisors does \\(25\\) have? If a triangle is a \\(3\\)-gon, a pentagon is a \\(5\\)-gon, and an octagon is an \\(8\\)-gon, what is a \\(4\\)-gon? Whats a \\(6\\)-gon? Whats a \\(2\\)-gon? Is \\(87\\) prime? How many multiples of \\(7\\) are two-digit numbers? How many pairs of adjacent sides does a triangle have? How many of the following are not lengths? circumference of a circle perimeter of a rectangle distance between two points width of a cuboid height of a cylinder Solution. 17 A square number (or perfect square) is the square of a whole number. Whole numbers (or integers) are numbers with digits only to the left of the decimal point. Non-whole numbers are numbers which have value to the right of the decimal point (and possibly to the left too). Two whole numbers a and b are consecutive if either \\(b = a + 1\\) or \\(a = b + 1\\). \\(a\\) divides \\(b\\) if \\(b ÷ a\\) leaves no remainder. Even numbers are whole numbers which can be written in the form \\(2n\\), where \\(n\\) is a whole number. Odd numbers are whole numbers which cannot be written in the form \\(2n\\), where \\(n\\) is a whole number. The absolute (or modulus) of a negativenumber is the positive version of that num-ber. A point has no length, width or height. A line has length but no width or height. A rectangle: a shape with four straight sides and four right angles A straight line: a line with unchanging slope A circle: a shape representing all the points equidistant from a single point A 3D shape: a shape with width, length and height A rational number: a number that be expressed at the ratio of two integers Consecutive even numbers: If a is an even number \\(2n\\), and \\(b = a+2\\), then \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are consecutive even numbers. Consecutive odd numbers: If \\(a\\) is an odd number \\(2n + 1\\), and \\(b = a + 2\\), then \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are consecutive odd numbers. MAX( ): Returns the largest of a set of numbers. MIN( ): Returns the smallest of a set of numbers. An acute angle: An angle measuring between \\(0\\) and \\(90\\) degrees. A circles circumference: The distant around the edge of a circle. A tangent to a circle: A straight line which intercepts a circle only once. The sum of two numbers: For two numbers \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), their sum is \\(a + b\\). The difference of two numbers: For two numbers \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), their difference is \\(a - b\\). The product of two numbers: For two numbers \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), their product is \\(a \\cdot b\\). The ratio of two numbers: For two numbers \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), their ratio is \\(a / b\\). A cube number (or perfect cube): A perfect cube is the cube of an integer. A triangle: A three-sided 2D shape. A cuboid: A 3D shape which has six rectangular faces at right angles to each other. Adjacent sides of a triangle: Two sides which meet at a common point. A multiple of a number: The number multiplied by any integer. An octagon: An eight-sided 2D shape. Two perpendicular lines: Two straight lines which meet at a right-angle. A prime number: An integer whose only two unique divisors are \\(1\\) and itself. The proper divisors (or proper factors) of a whole number: Integers which divide into another integer, excluding the number itself. What have we learnt? Axioms are special kinds of mathematical statements; they are ones which are self-evidently true. They are the building blocks of mathematics. Weve also learnt that really fundamental axioms are called definitions. They are how we are sure you, your fellow mathematicians and your reader all understand what youre talking about!18 https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/duh See https://www.aaamath.com/ac11.htm.

"],["mathematical-proof.html", "Chapter 6 Mathematical proof 6.1 Mathematics versus other fields 6.2 So what does this all mean?", " Chapter 6 Mathematical proof 6.1 Mathematics versus other fields Mathematical proof is different to proof in other fields. Lets look at how. 6.1.1 Terminology Mathematics has a different set of terms when talking about proofs. In mathematics, once we have identified a statement which we would like to try to prove or disprove, we rename it a **conjecture}. If we are successful in proving it, the conjecture is renamed a theorem. If it is disproved, it is called a **disproved conjecture}. Only statements that have been proved true} can be called theorems. Figure 6.1: The journey of a statement. * A mathematical statement obviously! Exercise 6.1 How many mathematical theorems can you name? 6.1.2 Methodology In mathematics we talk about theorems. In other sciences, they talk about theories. Whats the difference? It all about how the proof is constructed. A proof in mathematics must be built deductively. We say therefore that a theorem in mathematics is deductively true. In other words, you should be able to provide a list of steps which someone else could follow and arrive at the same conclusions. A proof in science is built on evidence. We say therefore that a scientific theory is empirically (or verifiably) true, based on observations made or evidence collected. To verify it, someone would need to either trust your evidence, or be able to recreate the evidence themselves.19 Thats the difference between a theorem in mathematics and a theory in science. 6.1.3 Trial and improvement In mathematics, once a conjectures truth value has been discovered, it remains this way forever. However in other sciences (both natural sciences and social sciences), theories are always changing, being improved upon and added to as more research is done and more discoveries are made. This is a key principle of modern science - it doesnt claim to know all the answers, but its aim is the truth, and it chooses as its foundations those theories which have the most compelling evidence.20 The theory of gravity, the theory of relativity, the theory of evolution and even the current form of the periodic table are all examples of theories which are constantly being changed and updated as new evidence is revealed. Some scientific theories have even been shown to be completely wrong. Heres a short list of some theories previously believed true but later disproven: https://www.famousscientists.org/10-most-famous-scientific-theories-that-were-later-debunked. 6.1.4 An ever-changing world Statements about world geography, international politics, currency markets, individual people, the state of technology and a lot else besides are all likely to all be time-dependent. Countries fall, empires collapse, capitals change, phones get faster, people and animals evolve. For example, the statement Nur-Sultan is the capital of Kazakhstan has a built-in time limit. It wont be true forever. We dont know how long it will be true for, but it wont be true forever. Sure, it is true at the moment, but what if the capital is renamed in future years? The truth value of the statement would change. The capital of Kazakhstan is located in the north of the country is also currently true. This statement is definitely more general, but is still time-dependent: the capital of Kazakhstan used to be located in the south of the country; whats stopping the location of the capital city shifting again in the future? And how long will Kazakhstan exist? All countries change over time. Eventually there wont be a Kazakhstan, or a France or a Benin or a Britain. 6.2 So what does this all mean? It means that the study of mathematics is different to other sciences, to economics, to philosophy, psychology, evolutionary biology, and all other fields of study. If something is proved in mathematics, its truth value wont change over time. Prove something is true in mathematics and you know that it has always been true and that it will remain true forever.21 In 5 years or 100 years or 1000 years or a million years, the truth value will be unchanged. The axioms laid down by the Greek mathematician Euclid of Alexandria over two thousand years ago are as true now as they were then.22 The mathematical proofs of the mathematician Muhammad ibn Musa al-Khwarizmi, born near Khiva in Central Asia, which he presented in his book The Compendious Book on Calculation by Completion and Balancing,23 have not had their truth values changed in the hundreds of years since. The many proofs of French mathematician Sophie Germain are as valid now as they were in the 18th and 19th century when she wrote them. The mathematics of American mathematician Katherine Johnson in the 1960s or the Iranian mathematician Maryam Mirzakhani in the 2000s and 2010s will remain relevant forever. Anything You prove true in this course will be true forever. Anything you show is false will be false forever. Get ready to make your mark on history! What have we learnt? As discussed in Chapter 3, a good mathematical statement has an unchanging truth value. Unfortunately, in many fields, the truth value of statements can change over time. Something known as reproducibility. This approach provides a stable platform for further exploration. Just because science cant definitively say whether a statement is 100% true, its chosen approach is better than throwing our hands up and saying who knows! or ``no one can be sure!. Considering that we have science to thank for iPhones, vaccinations against deadly diseases, increased food yields, an understanding of how all life on Earth is connected, and a great many other things, its a pretty good approach! For example, proving Pythagoras Theorem (https://www.pinterest.com/pin/300122762659059179/) tells us this theorem is true for all time. See https://plus.maths.org/content/maths-minute-euclids-axioms. The title of this book gave the us the word algebra, from the Arabic word al-jabr meaning restoration, the reunion of broken parts or sometimes bone-setting. "],["disproving-a-conjecture.html", "Chapter 7 Disproving a conjecture 7.1 Finding a counterexample 7.2 Finding a disproof", " Chapter 7 Disproving a conjecture Weve discussed truth values a lot already, and weve agreed that mathematical statements must be either true or they are false. Once weve decided that were interested in finding out the truth value of a mathematical statement, we rename it a conjecture and get to work To prove a conjecture means to show that its truth value is true. To disprove a conjecture means to show that its truth value is false. In this chapter well discuss disproving conjectures. Theres two ways to show a conjecture is false. 7.1 Finding a counterexample Disproving false conjectures is generally easier than proving true conjectures. This is because all false conjectures have counterexamples. Take a look at the following two conjectures: Example 7.1 No Chinese citizen has green eyes. Example 7.2 All Irish citizens have a vowel in their surname. How you would prove, or disprove, these conjectures? To prove this first one, we would need to check the eye colour of all Chinese citizens. Thats because this is a conjecture about all Chinese citizens. How long is that going to take!?! Is it even possible?!? But to disprove this conjecture, we just need to find one Chinese citizen with green eyes. Much easier! This single green-eyed Chinese citizen would be our counterexample. To prove the second conjecture, we would need to consult a database of the surnames of all Irish citizens. We would then set up a computer to check that each of them contain a vowel (a, e, i, o or u). To disprove the conjecture, we would just need to identify just one Irish citizen whose surname did not contain a vowel. This could be done using the database approach as well, or maybe we know of a famous Irish person whose surname is vowel-less. This one person would be our counterexample. Just one counterexample is needed to disprove a false conjecture. Of course, we might find lots of counterexamples, i.e. many Chinese citizens who have green eyes, or many Irish citizens without vowels in their surname. This would be great - it would probably make our job of finding a counterexample easier! But even if there is only one Chinese citizen with green eyes, or one Irish citizen with a surname devoid of vowels, that is enough to show the conjecture is false. Before you do anything, make an educated guess. Do you believe either of these conjectures are true. Or false? Your first step with any new conjectures is to look for a counterexample. A single counterexample is enough to disprove a conjecture. Exercise 7.1 The following conjectures are all false. Find a single counterexample which shows this. All prime numbers are odd.} \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + b^2\\) for any numbers \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). All sheep in South Africa are white. (Good luck Googling!) The national flags of all UN members are rectangular. All numbers are either positive or negative. \\(a^2 &gt; a\\), where \\(a\\) is a whole number. If \\(a\\) is a whole number and \\(a^2\\) is divisible by \\(4\\), then \\(a\\) is divisible by 4. Exercise 7.2 In the last question, you found counterexamples which disproved the conjectures. Which of the conjectures above have just one counterexample? Which of the conjectures above have a few counterexamples? Which of the conjectures above have an infinite number of counterexamples? 7.2 Finding a disproof Finding a counterexample is the most common and popular way of disproving a conjecture. Its also possible to disprove a conjecture without finding a counterexample. This is called finding a disproof. Well look at this a bit later. What have we learnt? Finding a counterexample (or a few) is the most popular and common way to disprove a conjecture. Whilst there may be many counterexamples for a particular conjecture, just one is enough to disprove a conjecture. True conjectures dont have counterexamples, because theyre true! Only conjectures which are false will have counterexamples. In the following exercise, we will encounter some axioms about inequalities. Inequalities describe the ordering of real numbers. Lets first check we know what real numbers are. Real numbers Real numbers are any numbers on the number line which stretches from \\(-\\infty\\) to \\(\\infty\\). Any number that a calculator can display is a real number! Real numbers are: Whole numbers (integers) Terminating decimals (0.1, -0.5, 68.25) Recurring decimals (\\(\\frac{1}{3} = 0.3333...\\), \\(-\\frac{11}{9} = -1.2222...\\), \\(\\frac{1}{7} = 0.142857142857...\\)) Non-recurring decimals (\\(\\pi = 3.1415926...,\\) \\(e = 2.7182818284590\\), \\(\\sqrt{2} = 1.41421356237...\\)) There are two types of real number: - Rational numbers} can be expressed as the ratio of two whole numbers. For example: \\(\\frac{1}{2}, -\\frac{3}{4}\\) (or \\(\\frac{-3}{4}), \\frac{11}{3}\\), 4 (or \\(\\frac{4}{1}\\)), -7 (or \\(\\frac{-7}{1}\\)), 0 (or \\(\\frac{0}{1}\\)), 1 (or \\(\\frac{1}{1}\\)). - Irrational numbers} cant be written as the ratio of two whole numbers. For example: \\(\\pi, e, \\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3}\\). Exercise 7.3 Here are two axioms about inequalities: If \\(a&gt;0\\) and \\(b&gt;0\\), then \\(a+b&gt;0\\). If \\(a&gt;0\\) and \\(b&gt;0\\), then \\(ab&gt;0\\). (If \\(a&gt;0\\) and \\(b&gt;0\\), then \\(a + b &gt; a\\) and \\(a + b &gt; b\\).) Exercise 7.4 Because these are axioms, we cant prove them (they are too fundamental). However, we can illustrate them with examples. Find examples of each of the two axioms above, to illustrate them. Exercise 7.5 Below are five more axioms about inequalities. Again, illustrate each of these axioms with an example. If \\(a &gt; b\\) and \\(k\\) is any real number, then \\(a + k &gt; b + k\\). If \\(a &gt; b\\) and \\(b &gt; c\\), then \\(a &gt; c\\). If \\(a &gt; b\\) and \\(k &gt; 0\\) then \\(ak &gt; bk\\). If \\(a &gt; b\\) and \\(k &lt; 0\\), then \\(ak &lt; bk\\). For any real number \\(a\\), \\(a^2 \\geq 0\\). Exercise 7.6 Below are four conjectures about inequalities. Find counterexamples which disprove them: If \\(a&gt;0\\) and \\(b&gt;0\\), then \\(ab &gt; a\\) and \\(ab &gt; b\\). If \\(a^2 &lt; b^2\\) then \\(a &lt; b\\). If \\(a &lt; b\\) and \\(k &lt; l\\) then \\(ak &lt; bl\\). If \\(\\dfrac{a}{b} &gt; cd\\) then \\(ad &gt; bc\\). You only need to find one counterexample for each. Hint: Negative numbers will be useful here! Before we move on, lets review types of numbers. We divide real numbers (symbol \\(\\mathbb{R}\\)) in two groups: Integers, terminating decimals and recurring decimals are called rationals (symbol \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\)), because they can all be expressed as the ratio of two integers. Non-recurring decimals cant be expressed at the ratio of two integers and are therefore called irrationals (symbol \\(\\mathbb{Q}&#39;\\)). Figure 7.1: Types of numbers. How to use these symbols? To tell your reader that youre talking about a general real number, you write \\(a \\in \\mathbb{R}\\), where \\(\\in\\) means belongs to or is. If a conjecture doesnt mention what type of number its talking about, assume its dealing with all the real numbers.24 If you are specifically dealing with the integers, you can specify this by saying \\(a \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\). If youre dealing with all the rational numbers, you write \\(a \\in \\mathbb{Q}\\). And if youre dealing with just irrational numbers, write \\(a \\in \\mathbb{Q}&#39;\\).2526 Finally, add \\(^{+}\\) to any symbol to specify youre only talking about the positive numbers from the set. Similarly, add \\(^{-}\\) to specify youre only talking about the negative numbers from the set. Exercise 7.7 What type of number is \\(a\\) in each of the following? Give a couple of examples of each. \\(a \\in \\mathbb{Z}^{+}\\) \\(a \\in \\mathbb{Q}&#39;\\) \\(a \\in \\mathbb{Q}^{+}\\) \\(a \\in \\mathbb{Z}^{*}\\) \\(a \\in \\mathbb{Z}^{-}\\) \\(a \\in \\mathbb{R}\\) \\(a \\in \\mathbb{C}\\) \\(a \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\) \\(a \\in \\mathbb{R}^{+}\\) Within the integers, there are lots of sets of special numbers, for example even numbers, odd numbers, prime numbers, triangle numbers, Fibonacci numbers, and perfect numbers. Some of these sets overlap. And within these sets, there are even smaller subsets of numbers. For example, the Mersenne primes are special examples of primes. Exercise 7.8 Can you find: A number which is both prime and triangular? A number which is both prime and perfect? A number which is both triangular and perfect? Exercise 7.9 Are there any prime Fibonacci numbers? Exercise 7.10 Is 1 perfect? Triangular? Prime? A Fibonacci number? Is 2 perfect? Triangular? Prime? A Fibonacci number? Exercise 7.11 Whats the smallest positive integer that is neither prime nor triangular nor perfect nor Fibonacci? There are some numbers which are not real (called complex numbers). Although we will only be dealing with real numbers in this course, we state \\(a \\in \\mathbb{R}\\) to avoid confusion. Rational and irrational numbers have very different properties. The digits of rational numbers (including non-terminating decimal numbers) are fully known. The digits of irrational numbers cant be fully known because they follow no pattern and dont repeat. Just because you know the first 12 million decimal digits of \\(\\pi\\), it doesnt mean you can predict the 12-million-and-first digit! Whilst \\(\\pi\\) and \\(e\\) are both known to be irrational, no one knows if \\(\\pi + e\\), \\(\\pi e\\), \\(\\dfrac{\\pi}{e}\\), \\(\\pi^e\\), \\(\\pi^\\pi\\), \\(e^e\\), \\(e^\\pi\\), \\(2^e\\) or ln\\(\\pi\\) are rational or irrational. See https://math.ou.edu/\\char`\\~jalbert/courses/openprob2.pdf. "],["proving-a-conjecture.html", "Chapter 8 Proving a conjecture 8.1 Step 1: Start by looking for a counterexample 8.2 Step 2: Try to build a proof", " Chapter 8 Proving a conjecture So far we have seen that axioms are statements which cant be proved, because they are so fundamental. Axioms (and the even more fundamental definitions) are statements which allow us to talk about and do mathematics. Exercise 8.1 Here are four more axioms. All of these axioms are about probability. How many of these have you heard about or used before? The probability of something happening is a non-negative, real number. The probability of something happening is never greater than 1. The probability that at least one of the possible events will happen is 1. The sum of the probabilities of all possible events is 1. Any mathematical statement that is not an axiom or a definition and that were interested in proving or disproving can be reclassified a conjecture. We can then attempt to prove it or disprove it. Follow these steps when meeting a new conjecture 8.1 Step 1: Start by looking for a counterexample When beginning with a new conjecture, you (probably) dont know whether its true or false. Therefore, your first step should always be to look for a counterexample. We saw in the last chapter that to disprove a false statement, we just need to find a single counterexample to disprove it. If you find one, then you have disproved the conjecture, and dont need to worry about trying to prove it (as you know its false!). If you dont find one, it doesnt mean there isnt one, but at least you tried. Looking for a counterexample is also a good place to begin with a new conjecture because it helps you to understand what the conjecture is saying. How long should you look for a counterexample? I would suggest trying out four or five examples to see if any of them are counterexamples. Exercise 8.2 Try to find a counterexample of the following conjectures. Im not promising that they are all false so it might be that a counterexample doesnt exist for some of them. Multiples of \\(4\\) are divisible by \\(8\\). For two real numbers \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), \\(|a||b| = |ab|\\). Every whole number greater than \\(2\\) can be written as the difference of two perfect squares. (For example, \\(11 = 36 - 25, 12 = 16 - 4, 13 = 49 - 36\\).) Every positive odd number can be written as the difference of two perfect squares. All triangles contain at least one angle measuring \\(\\geq 60^{\\circ}\\).} All triangles contain at most one angle measuring \\(\\geq 60^{\\circ}\\). *Hint: Being creative when trying to find a counterexample will increase your chance of finding a one (if it exists). For example, with the second conjecture, try an example where \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both positive, then an example where \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both negative. Then you could try an example where \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) have different signs, then an example where one or both of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are equal to zero. Keeping going until you think youve tried all possible types of example. Obviously stop if you find a counterexample.* If you fail to find a counterexample, maybe the conjecture is true. Or maybe you just werent able to find a counterexample, even though one (or more) exists.27 Because we dont know which, we move onto Step 2 8.2 Step 2: Try to build a proof We dont know if the conjecture is true or false, but our attempts to disprove it by finding a counterexample failed. Our next step is to attempt to build a proof. If the conjecture is true, we should be able to construct a proof to show this. If it is actually false, then as we build our proof we will find it breaks somehow. This would be called a disproof. Whilst finding a disproof is sufficient in showing the conjecture to be false, the disproof might make it easier to find a counterexample to the conjecture. Note When trying to build a proof, be optimistic and believe that the conjecture is true. Expecting the proof to fail is not a good mindset for effective proof building! There are many different methods of proof we could build, and our choice will depend on the type of conjecture. We might have to try out several of the methods before we find the one that works. Also, different people might use different methods for the same conjecture. Thats fine. As long as they both come to the same conclusion about the conjectures truth value, the method used isnt important. 8.2.1 Ifthen No matter what method you decide to start with, make sure the conjecture is in the form If  then . If the conjecture is not in this form, rewrite it so that it is. Why is the If  then . form so important? The if part signals the conjectures starting point, and the then part signals the conjectures destination. It means we know where to begin our proof, and where were headed whilst were building the proof. Example 8.1 Multiples of even numbers are even. Rewritten in the If  then  form, this conjecture becomes If \\(a\\) is an even number, then \\(ka\\) is even, where \\(k \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\). We use the letter \\(P\\) to indicate the starting point of a conjecture, and the letter \\(Q\\) to indicate the destination. So for the above conjecture: Here are some more examples, taken from Exercise 6.1.1. The original conjecture is on the left, and the If  then  form on the right: \\(P\\): \\(a\\) is an even number \\(Q\\): \\(ka\\) is even, where \\(k \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\) Original conjecture If  then  All prime numbers are odd If \\(p\\) is prime, then \\(p\\) is odd \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + b^2\\) for any numbers \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) If \\(a\\) and \\(b \\in \\mathbb{R}\\), then \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + b^2\\) All sheep in South Africa are white If a sheep lives in South Africa, then it is white The national flags of all UN members are rectangular If a country is a UN member, then its flag is rectangular All numbers are either positive or negative If \\(a \\in \\mathbb{R}\\), then \\(a\\) is either positive or negative \\(a^2 &gt; a\\), where \\(a\\) is a whole number If \\(a \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\), then \\(a^2 &gt; a\\) Exercise 8.3 For each example above, what is \\(P\\)? What is \\(Q\\)? Exercise 8.4 For each of the six conjectures from Exercise 8.2: Rewrite them in the If  then  form. What is \\(P\\) for each? And \\(Q\\)? 8.2.2 Draw the map Once the conjecture is in the form If  then , you should attempt to draw the conjectures map. Its not always possible to draw a conjectures map, but if youre able to it can really help you choose the most appropriate method of proof for that conjecture. Heres the format of a conjecture map: Notice we start on the left side of the picture and finish on the right. Next, we add \\(P\\) and \\(Q\\). Well use the conjecture from above, If \\(a\\) is an even number, then \\(ka\\) is even, where \\(k \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\). You can see that \\(P\\) has been added to the left side of the map and \\(Q\\) to the right side. Above the map we write what type of number were considering, in this case integers. Below the map, we write details of any variables (e.g. \\(k\\)) that the conjecture uses. Next we add the opposite of \\(P\\) and the opposite of \\(Q\\) to the map. What does the opposite mean? Well, in the example above, the numbers were considering are the integers. We put the even ones in \\(P\\), and all those which are not even (so odd) in \\(S\\) (see below). Similarly, if you multiply an integer \\(a\\) (even or odd) by another integer (\\(k\\)), the result will be another integer. The even \\(ka\\) were storing in \\(Q\\), and the odd \\(ka\\) will go into \\(T\\). Finally, we add arrows to the map to represent what the conjecture is saying. Arrows can only go from the left side of the map to the right side. Therefore, the conjecture map of the statement multiples of even numbers are even is: This can all seem really confusing, but trying to draw a couple of conjecture maps yourself will really help. Exercise 8.5 Draw the conjecture map for the following conjectures. The square of a prime number is also prime. Integers retain their parity when squared. The sum of two consecutive integers is odd. Numbers retain their sign when cubed. Exercise 8.6 Draw the conjecture map of the conjecture from Exercise 8.2 (a), (c) and (d). Exercise 8.7 Why is it difficult to draw a conjecture map for Exercise 8.2 (b), (e) and (f)? 8.2.3 Choose your method Once you have written the conjecture in the form If  then  and have attempted (hopefully successfully) in drawing its map, you are ready to begin to try building a proof. We have lots of choices of methods of proof available. In this course, well look at: proof by exhaustion, direct proof, proof by cases, proof using previously proved or disproved conjectures, proof via the contrapositive, proof by contradiction, and proof by induction. Each of chapters 10 - 16 will cover one of these methods, and give you some examples to practice on. At the end of each chapter there will be some more conjectures to work on. These conjectures might be true or might be false. To prove the true ones, you will be expected not just to rely on the method introduced in that chapter, but all previous methods too. This is because the challenge (and fun) of proving conjectures comes from not knowing where to start and feeling your own way to a proof. Its a very satisfying experience!28 Chapter 17 is a bonus chapter, and covers the incompleteness of mathematics. The next chapter, chapter 9, looks at what makes a good proof. This could be for a number of reasons, such as the the counterexample(s) are really really big, or maybe because you forgot to check all types of examples. Also, maybe you were just unlucky. Also, when presented with a set of conjectures and told to Prove using a direct proof or Prove by induction, like a robot you will switch your brain off and switch on your autopilot, which we dont want!

( There is something that connects the work of Euclid and al-Khwarizmi and Germain and Johnson and Mirzakhani - all of their mathematical proofs were valid. For a proof to be declared as valid it should be: Universal: A proof written by one person should be understandable by another. Clear: All terms should be defined, as well as any variables used. Watertight. This means that it shouldnt contain any holes. No one should be able to criticise you for not considering something.29 Complete: Your proof should cover all cases described or inferred by the statement.30 General: Your proof cant just relate to specific examples of the statements; it should cover all possible cases of the statement. Mathematicians cant check the validity of their own work - they offer to their peers who then check it for validity. Germain did this, Mirzakhani did this, Euclid did. Once your peers have approved it, you then can publish your proof as a piece of mathematics. Its at this point that you enter the history books! The reason you shouldnt check the validity of your own work is that you wrote it. Its very hard to notice mistakes or holes in your own work.\\footnote[This is why I always think its strange to tell students at the end of an exam Check your paper for mistakes before giving it in. You might notice a question you forgot to answer or a piece of work you forgot to cross out, but its very difficult to check your own work for actual mistakes. You wrote it, so youre not the best person to check it!] However, as you move through the rest of this book, you will start to get a sense of when you have finished a proof. Knowing when a proof is finished, and when it is not finished, is a skill you should try to develop. ) Generally speaking, a mathematical proof is a rigorous demonstration that a mathematical statement is true. As an elementary example, consider the following conjecture. We wont discuss exactly which method of proof were using here, just show a proof to give an idea of how a rigorous proof looks. We will also see an example of a bad proof of this conjecture, for comparison. Notice that the conjecture has a number (in this case 9.1). This is so we can refer back to it, especially in work on later conjectures. Conjecture 9.1 : If \\(a\\) and \\(c\\) are positive real numbers and \\(x = \\pm \\sqrt{\\frac{c}{a}}\\), then \\(ax^2-c=0\\). A couple of observations before we begin our proof: Note that \\(a, c &gt;0\\) implies that \\(a \\neq 0\\), which is important as its the denominator of the fraction \\(\\frac{c}{a}\\). This means that \\(\\frac{c}{a}\\) is defined. Also note that \\(a, c &gt; 0\\) implies that \\(\\frac{c}{a} &gt; 0\\) which is important as it is under a square root. This means that \\(\\sqrt{\\frac{c}{a}}\\) is **defined}. Proving this conjecture is not too challenging, using our axioms of algebra. Have a go yourself, then turn to the next page to see how our proofs compare! Proof. Our starting point \\(P\\) is \\(x = \\pm \\sqrt{\\frac{c}{a}}\\), with \\(a, c \\in \\mathbb R^+\\). If \\[\\begin{align} x &amp;= \\pm \\sqrt{\\frac{c}{a}}\\tag{9.1} \\end{align}\\] then squaring both sides, meaning both sides are positive and equivalent, \\[\\begin{align} x^2 &amp;= \\left(\\pm \\sqrt{\\frac{c}{a}} \\right)^2 \\tag{9.2} \\\\ &amp;= \\frac{c}{a} \\tag{9.3} \\end{align}\\] Multiplying both sides by \\(a\\), which we can do as \\(a\\neq 0\\), we get \\[\\begin{align} ax^2 &amp;= c \\tag{9.4} \\\\ ax^2 - c &amp;= 0 \\tag{9.5} \\end{align}\\] We have shown that \\(x = \\pm \\sqrt{\\frac{c}{a}}\\Rightarrow ax^2 - c = 0\\) as required. Heres a couple of things to notice: We label the conjecture with its reference number from the textbook, in this case Conjecture 9.1, so that if we need to we can refer back to it and its proof/disproof later. As well see in a later chapter, we often use work weve done previously, and having a quick way to refer back to previous conjectures and their proofs/disproof can speed this up for us. I have labelled EVERY line in the proof with a reference number ((9.1), (9.2), (9.3), (9.4), (9.5)). You dont need to label every line of a proof, but you should label important lines, so that you can easily refer back to them later in the proof, or in later work. When should you label a line? Whenever you need to refer specifically to it later on. Notice that we used the \\(\\square\\) symbol to indicate that the proof is finished. This statement was not difficult to prove. The presentation above was given to demonstrate how to write a clear, comprehensive, cohesive and rigorous (watertight) argument. To underline why the above prof is well written, we provide a second proof of Conjecture: 9.1, which well then criticise: Proof. 2: \\[\\begin{align} ax^2 + c &amp;= x^2 + \\frac{c}{a} = 0 \\tag{9.6} \\\\ &amp;= x \\Rightarrow \\pm \\sqrt{\\frac{c}{a}} \\tag{9.7} \\end{align}\\] You can probably see very easily that Proof 2 is far from perfect. However, you might argue that the person who wrote the answer more or less knew why \\(x = \\pm \\sqrt{\\frac{c}{a}}\\Rightarrow ax^2 - c = 0\\); so why bother being so precise when formulating a proof? The two main problems with Proof 2 is twofold. Firstly, it is really hard for the reader to follow. Secondly, when you are not absolutely clear about what your assumptions are, or dont properly justify implications, it is easy to run into trouble. Heres another example which demonstrates this: Proof. Let \\[\\begin{align} x=y \\end{align}\\] As \\(x=y\\), \\[\\begin{align} y(x-y) &amp;= x(x-y) \\tag{9.8} \\end{align}\\] Also, \\[\\begin{align} &amp; x(x-y) = x^2 - xy - x^2 - y^2 = (x+y)(x-y) = 2y(x-y) \\tag{9.9} \\end{align}\\] So, \\[\\begin{align} y(x-y) &amp;= 2y(x-y) \\tag{9.10} \\end{align}\\] or \\[\\begin{align} 1 &amp;= 2 \\tag{9.11} \\end{align}\\] Exercise 9.1 Be as critical of ``Proof 2 as you can be; find as many mistakes/ambiguities/places where the argument can be improved as possible. Exercise 9.2 Prove the following conjecture: Conjecture 9.2 : If \\(a, b, c \\in \\mathbb R\\), with \\(a\\neq 0\\) and \\(b^2 - 4ac &gt; 0\\), and \\(x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\\), then \\(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\\). 9.2 Why prove something? Okay, so if we accept that proofs are important, then we accept that they should be written carefully and precisely. However, we might ask why are proofs important? This is a big question, which we wont pretend to be able to answer in just a few short paragraphs. Instead, lets look at a few reasons why we should care about proving something: A proof of a mathematical statement is absolute; there is no exception to the rule. Such absolute statements are wonderful and do not exist in any other field of study! Mathematics is EVERYWHERE! From music to the economy, mathematics is used to help us reason about the world we live in. If we werent able to apply mathematical theorems that we have proved to be true, we would not know much about the world around us. It is possible to know when you can not do better; for example, cartographer wishing to buy as few colours as possible to colour her maps can be told by a mathematician that four different colours will be enough to colour her map to ensure adjacent areas are all differently coloured (this is called the *Four Colour Theorem}. Similarly mathematicians have been able to tell chemists when certain crystal structures have no mathematical obstructions (which led chemists to search for, and successfully produce, new crystal structures). There are numerous other examples of this kind. Perhaps most importantly, a mathematical proof precisely captures an idea; these ideas are often beautiful and elegant, and they deserve to be written down correctly. 9.3 How do I write a good proof? Here are some things to remember when writing proofs: Weve already mentioned a couple of good practices for proof writing, such as labeling the conjecture and important lines of work with references numbers, and ending the proof with the \\(\\square\\) symbol. Notice also that the first proof given for Conjecture 9.1 can be read, and understood independently of the conjecture, but that Proof 2 is completely obscure without the context of Conjecture 9.1! Always clearly state your assumptions. This becomes extra important with the method proof by contradiction, and is key with the method proof by cases. Always use English (or Kyrgyz, Spanish, Russian, Arabic or whichever language youre writing your proof in) to clearly convey what you mean; good mathematical arguments should read like an essay. The first sentence in the proof of Conjecture9.1 reads If \\(x\\) equals plus or minus the square root of \\(c\\) divided by \\(a\\) then \\(x\\) squared equals plus or minus the square root of \\(c\\) divided by \\(a\\) all squared, which equals \\(c\\) divided by \\(a\\). Whenever you write a proof, you should read through your answer and check to see if it could be read aloud and still be understood. Use words or symbols to correctly connect the mathematical statements which make up your proof. Take pride in the mathematics you write; when you write a piece of mathematics, you are showing people exactly how you think. So, you should try to write as elegantly and beautifully as you can! 9.4 Common mistakes in proof Here are some of the most common mistakes when writing proofs, all of which make your proof *invalid: Arguing from examples: Looking at examples is one of the most helpful practices a conjecture-prover can engage in. We discussed how useful it is to start with examples as a way-in to a new conjecture. However, it is a mistake to think that general statement can be proved by showing it to be true for some cases. For example, finding five right-angled triangles where Pythagoras Theorem is true does not prove that the theorem is true for all triangles. Using the same letter to mean two different things: Often beginner conjecture provers give a new variable quantity the same letter name as a previously introduced variable. This will confuse your reader. Claiming something is true without having justified it:. This is also called jumping to a conclusion. Assuming the thing to be proved is true: If you are trying to prove something is true, you cant assume it is true at the beginning of the proof. The reason for this is because assuming it true at the beginning might encourage you to use it as an established fact during your proof.31 The first of these means you havent actually started a proof. The second is not too much of a problem and is easily rectified. The last two would mean you have started a proof but that it contains fundamental problems. Both of these two are a headache to mathematicians and conjecture-provers around the world! 9.5 \\(=\\), \\(\\Rightarrow\\) and \\(\\Leftrightarrow\\) Finally, we discuss the important mathematical symbols \\(\\Rightarrow\\), \\(\\Leftrightarrow\\) and \\(=\\), and how they should be used in proofs. \\(=\\) The equals sign is used to denote an equality between mathematics expressions (not statements). So for example, \\(1+1=2\\), or \\(\\sin^2 \\theta + \\cos^2 \\theta = 1\\). \\(\\Rightarrow\\) The implies sign is used to denote when one mathematical statement follows directly from another. For example \\[\\begin{align} $x &amp;= 3 \\Rightarrow x^2 = 9$ \\end{align}\\] which is read if \\(x\\) equals three then \\(x\\) squared equals nine \\(\\Leftrightarrow\\) The equivalence sign is used to denote the equivalence of two mathematical statements. If \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are mathematical statements, then writing \\(A \\Leftrightarrow B\\) means that both \\(A \\Leftarrow B\\) and \\(B \\Leftarrow A\\) are true. For example, \\[\\begin{align} x - 1 &amp;= 0 \\Leftrightarrow x = 1 \\end{align}\\] Note that it would be wrong to write \\[\\begin{align} x^2 &amp;= 9 \\Leftrightarrow x = 3 \\end{align}\\] but correct to write \\[\\begin{align} x^2 &amp;= 9 \\Leftrightarrow x = \\pm 3 \\end{align}\\] Exercise 9.3 Look back to your proofs of Conjecture 9.1 and Conjecture 9.2. With everything youve read in mind, is there anything you would change about your proofs? Exercise 9.4 What is wrong with the following argument: Proof: Let \\[\\begin{align} x &amp;= 1 + 1 + ... + 1 \\text{ ($x$ times)} \\tag{9.12} \\end{align}\\] Multiplying both sides of Equality (9.12) by \\(x\\) we get: \\[\\begin{align} x^2 &amp;= x + x + ... + x \\tag{9.13} \\end{align}\\] Differentiating both sides of Equality (9.13) with respect to \\(x\\) we get \\[\\begin{align} 2x &amp;= 1 + 1 + ... + 1 = x \\tag{9.14} \\end{align}\\] Divide both sides of Equality (9.14) by \\(x\\), we conclude that \\[\\begin{align} 2 &amp;= 1 \\hspace{55mm}\\square \\end{align}\\] Note, proofs might be overly long or complicated, and this is a justified criticism we can make - proofs should always be as short and efficient as they can be (whilst still being complete). However, a valid proof dont stop being valid just because it is overly long. If the statement concerns all whole numbers, your proof would not be valid if it only covers positive numbers. If the statement concerns all polygons, your proof would not be valid if it only covers triangles and squares. A lawyer in court trying to prove a defendant guilty is not allowed to say, ``Because we know the defendant is guilty, we know he cant have been where he says he was on the night of the crime. Because we know he is guilty, we know he was at the scene of the crime that night. No one in the jury is going to be convinced by this argument! The lawyer must find explicit evidence that the defendant was at the scene of the crime that night.

However, it is very quick to unpack and will get us proving things immediately. It will give us a good launch pad onto more involved methods over the next few weeks. ) Our method this week is called proof by exhaustion. This doesnt mean you do it until you are exhausted. Rather, you do it until all possibilities are exhausted. It is closely related to another method we will look at in a couple of weeks. Lets relate it to some conjectures: Conjecture If true, how to prove by exhaustion? Practical?

This method works best for conjectures where the number of possibilities is low, as in (3).32 10.1 Steps Identify and list all possibilities.

(#cnj:wave:) The sum of two even numbers is even.} Rewritten conjecture : If \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are even integers, then \\(a+b\\) is even. Proof. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are even, they can be written as \\[\\begin{align} a &amp;= 2k \\\\ b &amp;= 2l \\end{align}\\] where \\(k\\) and \\(l\\) are integers. Therefore the sum of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) is \\[\\begin{align} a + b &amp;= 2k + 2l\\\\ &amp;= 2(k + l) \\end{align}\\] by factoring out 2. As the sum of integers equals an integer, \\(k + l\\) must equal some integer. Lets call it \\(m\\). Therefore we have \\[\\begin{align} a + b &amp;= 2m \\end{align}\\] which is clearly even. (#cnj:welcome:) The square of an odd number is also odd.} Rewritten conjecture: If \\(a\\) is an odd integer, then \\(a^2\\) is odd. Proof. If \\(a\\) is an odd integer, it can be expressed as \\[\\begin{align} a &amp;= 2k + 1 \\tag{11.1} \\end{align}\\] where \\(k\\) is an integer.

"],["using-previous-proofs-disproofs.html", "Chapter 12 Using previous proofs / disproofs", " Chapter 12 Using previous proofs / disproofs Noticing that a conjecture can be proved using previous work youve done can save you a lot of time! Aside from that, it can often show you the way that future conjectures can be proved. Lets assume we have already proved the conjecture: Conjecture 12.1 : Every prime number, except 2 and 3, is either one more or one less than a multiple of 6. Knowing this is true, we can use it in the proof of the conjecture: Conjecture 12.2 : Doubling every prime number (except 2) then adding two creates a number divisible by four. Proof. As conjecture 12.1 is known to be true, we know that every prime \\(p\\), \\(p \\neq 2, 3\\), can be written in the form \\[\\begin{align} p &amp;= 6k + 1 \\end{align}\\] or \\[\\begin{align} p &amp;= 6k - 1 \\end{align}\\] with \\(k \\in \\mathbb Z\\). Lets deal with these one-by-one. If \\[\\begin{align} p &amp;= 6k + 1 \\end{align}\\] then doubling it and adding two gives \\[\\begin{align} 2p + 2 &amp;= 2(6k + 1) + 2 \\\\ &amp;= 12p + 2 + 2 \\\\ &amp;= 12p + 4 \\\\ &amp;= 4(3p + 1) \\end{align}\\] which is a multiple of 4. Similarly, if \\[\\begin{align} p &amp;= 6k - 1 \\end{align}\\] then doubling it and adding two gives \\[\\begin{align} 2p + 2 &amp;= 2(6k - 1) + 2 \\\\ &amp;= 12p - 2 + 2 \\\\ &amp;= 12p \\\\ &amp;= 4(3p) \\end{align}\\] which is a multiple of 4. As noted in the first line of the proof, this proof covers all primes except \\(2\\) and \\(3\\). However, conjecture 12.2 covers all primes except \\(2\\), so we should also check that the conjecture holds for \\(3\\). If \\(p=3\\), then \\(2p+2 = 2 \\cdot 3 + 2 = 6 + 2 = 8\\), which is a multiple of \\(4\\). Therefore the conjecture is true. Exercise 12.1 The following conjectures might need you to use earlier work, or might not. Every prime number, except \\(2\\) and \\(3\\), is either one more or one less than a multiple of \\(6\\). (This is the conjecture on the previous page!) Hint: You might want to try writing the positive whole numbers greater than \\(3\\) in a rectangular grid, in such a way that all the primes are in only one or two columns. Doubling every prime number (except \\(2\\)) then adding two creates a number divisible by four. (We proved this on the previous page!) Squares of odd numbers are all one more than a multiple of \\(8\\). The only numbers which can be classed as odd or even are integers (whole numbers). \\(a^2 - a + 41\\) is always prime for all positive integers \\(a\\). \\(a^2 - a + 41\\) is always prime for all **nonpositive} integers \\(a\\). The interior angles of the octagon formed by joining the midpoint of each side of a square with each corner of the square are not all equal. Hint: Draw the picture first! \\(1^2\\), \\(11^2\\), \\(111^2\\), \\(1111^2\\),  are all palindromic numbers. A palindromic number is one that reads the same backwards as it does forwards, e.g. \\(987789\\) and \\(62926\\). Similarly, a word is palindromic if it reads the same backwards as it does forwards, e.g. racecar and noon. Sentences can be palindromic too, usually by ignoring spaces and punctuation, e.g. No lemon, no melon or Was it a cat I saw? Exercise 12.2 Something slightly different today: This chapter was all about using previously proved (or disproved) conjectures to aid your work on new proofs. Today, I want you to look back over all the previous conjectures weve proved and disproved and use your findings to write some new conjectures. Here are the rules: Each student should write at least two conjectures. The conjectures should be true. The conjectures should be provable using work which you and your classmates have previously done, and using the methods weve already met: direct proof and exhaustion. DONT rush - take your time to write these conjectures. Post your conjectures onto the XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXx padlet. Note: Post each conjecture whenever its ready to go!

Note: DONT solve too many conjectures - leave some for other people to solve!! If there are no unsolved conjectures left on the padlet, try solving one of the conjectures already solved. Maybe you can solve it in a different way?? If you think your classmate has written a conjecture which is actually false, tell them by posting a disproof (or counterexample) under their post.

In proof by cases, we use the same technique. The only difference is the list of possibilities are renamed cases, and each single case is much broader (more general and less specific) than each single possibility in a proof by exhaustion. For example, while the list of possibilities in a proof by exhaustion might be each whole number from 1 to 20 or each possible route taken by a knight on a chessboard, the cases in a proof by cases might be all negative numbers and all non-negative numbers, or all even integers between 1 and 20 and all odd integers between 1 and 20, or all whole numbers and all non-whole numbers. Lets compare a couple of conjectures we previously proved by exhaustion and a couple which can be proved using cases, to see the difference between possibilities in a proof by exhaustion and cases in a proof by cases. Conjecture Proof by exhaustion Proof by cases Conjecture 10.3 (see Chapter 10) The video solution identified four possible divisors of \\(97\\) (using some clever reasoning about prime numbers and the square root of \\(97\\) to not identify more possibilities than necessary) and then checked them all. Finding none divided \\(97\\), and being satisfied that this list of candidate divisors was complete, the conjecture was declared true. Conjecture 10.4 (see Chapter 10) In the video solution, the list of possibilities was identified as the integers \\(0, 1, 2, 3, ..., 9\\). Again, this list was long enough to ensure completeness but not longer than it needed to be. Conjecture 13.1 : Integers retain their parity when squared. We should first check the conjecture is true for even integers, then check its true for odd integers. Case 1: All even integers. Case 2: All odd integers. As all integers are either even or odd, were done! Conjecture 13.2 : For \\(a, b \\in \\mathbb R\\), \\(|a + b| \\leq |a| + |b|\\). As were dealing with the modulus function33, it makes sense to build cases by varying the sign of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). We could try: Case 1: \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) both \\(\\geq 0\\). Case 2: \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) both \\(&lt; 0\\). Case 3: \\(a \\geq 0\\) and \\(b &lt;0\\). Case 4: \\(a &lt; 0\\) and \\(b \\geq 0\\). Notice we can collapse cases 3 and 4 into one by simply switching the letters without loss of generality, so actually we only require three cases. Conjecture 13.3 : All perfect squares are either a multiple of \\(3\\) or one more than a multiple of \\(3\\). What do you think?? What cases should we use??? 13.3 Without loss of generality In the table on the previous page, we referred to the phrase without loss of generality, or simply w.l.o.g. We can use it whenever simply switching the letters doesnt fundamentally change the case were looking at. Example 13.1 Consider conjecture 13.2 from the table: Conjecture 13.2 : For \\(a, b \\in \\mathbb R\\), \\(|a + b| \\leq |a| + |b|\\). We use Case 1 to check if the conjecture is true when both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are non-negative. We use Case 2 to check if the conjecture is true when both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are negative. Finally, we should check if the conjecture is true if one of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) is negative and the other is non-negative. We say, without loss of generality, that the negative one will be \\(b\\) and the non-negative one will be \\(a\\). This means we need just three cases, not four: Case 1: \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) both \\(\\geq 0\\). Case 2: \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) both \\(&lt; 0\\). Case 3: \\(a \\geq 0\\) and \\(b &lt;0\\). If we want to demonstrate this conjecture to someone by asking them to pick two numbers, and they pick one negative number and one non-negative number, we can assign the negative one to \\(b\\) and the non-negative one to \\(a\\). Example 13.2 Consider the conjecture Conjecture 13.4 : The product of an odd integer and an even integer is even. We are considering the product of two integers, \\(a \\cdot b\\). One of these integers is even, and the other is odd. W.l.o.g., lets say that \\(a\\) is the even one and \\(b\\) is the odd one, so \\[\\begin{align} a &amp;= 2m \\\\ b &amp;= 2n + 1 \\end{align}\\] with \\(m, n \\in \\mathbb Z\\). Notice I have used two different integers here, \\(m\\) and \\(n\\), as the conjecture doesnt say \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) must be consecutive (though of course they can be). We have \\[\\begin{align} a \\cdot b &amp;= (2m)\\cdot (2n+1) \\\\ &amp;= 4mn + 2m\\\\ &amp;= 2(2mn+m) \\end{align}\\] which is clearly even. Again, if I wanted to demonstrate this conjecture to someone by asking them to pick two numbers, one even and one odd, I just assign the even one to \\(a\\) and the odd one to \\(b\\). If we had made \\(a\\) the odd one and \\(b\\) the even one, the proof would look identical, so our choice of which was odd and which was even was unimportant. Thats what w.l.o.g. means! Sometimes, however, w.l.o.g. doesnt work. Thats because changing the letters does fundamentally change the case were considering. Lets look at an example Example 13.3 Consider the conjecture Conjecture 13.5 : The product of two consecutive numbers is even.34 We are considering the product of two integers, \\(a \\cdot b\\). If two integers \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are consecutive, then \\(b = a + 1\\). If we multiply them, we get \\[\\begin{align} a \\cdot b &amp;= (a)(a+1) \\\\ &amp;= a^2 + a \\end{align}\\] but it isnt obvious that this is even, so well need a new strategy. As \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are consecutive integers, one is even, and the other is odd, because parity alternates for integers. Lets make \\(a\\) the even one and \\(b\\) the odd one, so, \\[\\begin{align} a &amp;= 2m \\\\ b &amp;= 2m + 1 \\end{align}\\] Their product is \\[\\begin{align} (2m)\\cdot (2m+1) &amp;= 4m^2 + 2m\\\\ &amp;= 2(2m^2+m) \\end{align}\\] which is clearly even. But notice, this proof only covers pairs of consecutive integers where the smaller number is even, for example 2 and 3, 4 and 5, or \\(-2\\) and \\(-1\\). It does not cover pairs of consecutive integers where the smaller number is odd. If you ask a friend to pick two consecutive numbers and they pick 7 and 8, we must assign 7 to \\(a\\) as its the smaller of the two numbers, but we cant assign 7 to \\(a\\) because we said lets make \\(a\\) the even one. We can label the case above as Case 1, then provide a second case, where \\(a\\) is odd and \\(b\\) is even: Case 2: \\[\\begin{align} a &amp;= 2m + 1 \\\\ b &amp;= (2m + 1) + 1 = 2m + 2 \\end{align}\\] The product is \\[\\begin{align} (2m + 1)\\cdot (2m+2) &amp;= 4m^2 + 4m + 2\\\\ &amp;= 2(2m^2+2m + 1) \\end{align}\\] which is clearly even. Weve shown that this conjecture is true if the smaller of the two consecutive numbers is even, and if the smaller of the two consecutive numbers is odd. These two cases cover all possible pairs of consecutive numbers, and in both cases, we found the statement to be true, so the conjecture is true. We are done! Heres what the proof looks like in full: Proof. We call our two consecutive numbers \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). W.l.o.g., let \\(a\\) be the smaller of the two. Case 1: \\(a\\) even, \\(b\\) odd. \\[\\begin{align} a &amp;= 2m \\\\ b &amp;= 2m + 1 \\end{align}\\] Thus, \\[\\begin{align} a \\cdot b &amp;= (2m)\\cdot (2m+1) \\\\ &amp;= 4m^2 + 2m\\\\ &amp;= 2(2m^2+m) \\end{align}\\] which is clearly even. Case 2: \\(a\\) odd, \\(b\\) even. \\[\\begin{align} a &amp;= 2m + 1 \\\\ b &amp;= (2m + 1) + 1 = 2m + 2 \\end{align}\\] Thus, \\[\\begin{align} a \\cdot b &amp;= (2m + 1)\\cdot (2m+2) \\\\ &amp;= 4m^2 + 4m + 2\\\\ &amp;= 2(2m^2+2m + 1) \\end{align}\\] which is clearly even. 13.4 Knowing when to use cases This will come with practice, I promise! 13.5 Choosing the cases Once you have recognised that your proof will require cases, it can sometimes be difficult deciding how to split the proof up. The most important thing to remember when using cases is to make them distinct (they should not overlap) and complete (they should consider all possible situations). For example, if \\(P\\) says \\(a\\) is an integer and you split the proof into positive integers and negative integers, then you have forgotten to consider \\(a = 0\\), and your cases are not complete. You will have to amend one of the two cases to include \\(a = 0\\), or add it as its own case. Similarly, if you have the cases \\(a \\geq 0\\) and \\(a \\leq 0\\), then 0 is contained in both cases, meaning the cases overlap, which also isnt good. You should amend one of the cases so it no longer includes 0. Here are some examples of how you might split up a proof into cases, depending on what type of number the conjecture concerns: \\(a \\in \\mathbb Z\\) Case 1: \\(a\\) is even Case 2: \\(a\\) is odd Case 1: \\(a = 3k\\) Case 2: \\(a = 3k + 1\\) Case 3: \\(a = 3k + 2\\) with \\(k \\in \\mathbb Z\\) \\(a \\in \\mathbb R\\) Case 1: \\(a\\) is rational Case 2: \\(a\\) is irrational Case 1: \\(|a| &gt; 1\\) Case 2: \\(|a| \\leq 1\\) \\(a \\in \\mathbb Z\\) or \\(\\mathbb R\\) Case 1: \\(a\\) is positive Case 2: \\(a\\) is negative Case 3: \\(a\\) = 0 Pairs of numbers \\(a, b\\) Case 1: both \\(a, b &gt; 0\\) Case 2: both \\(a, b &lt; 0\\) Case 3: \\(a &gt; 0\\) and \\(b &lt; 0\\) (w.l.o.g.) Case 4: at least one of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) equals 0 Case 1: \\(a,b \\neq 0\\) Case 2: at least one of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) equals 0 Exercise 13.1 Verify that for the above examples, the cases are distinct and complete. Note: You might split the proof into cases differently to a classmate. Dont worry! Theres many ways to prove the same thing - just make sure that when splitting up the problem into cases, you dont miss any numbers! Once you have split the problem into parts, consider each part separately from one another. 13.6 How many cases? For conjectures in this course that require a proof by cases, you will probably need 2, 3, or maybe 4 cases. However, there is no upper limit for how many you can use. Proofs involving between 5 and 10 cases are common. You should always try to use the smallest number of cases possible. The first proof of the Four Colour Theorem35 used 1936 cases. Since then, mathematicians have managed to reduce this number to close to 600, which is still a lot, but less than 1936! Exercise 13.2 a. Prove conjecture 13.1 from the table earlier in this chapter. Remember that we discussed the cases for this conjecture in the table. Prove conjecture 13.2 from the table earlier in this chapter. Remember that we discussed the cases for this conjecture in the table and afterwards. Prove conjecture 13.3 from the table earlier in this chapter. You will have to decide on the cases for this one. Your classmates might make different choices to you, and thats OK! Exercise 13.3 All of the conjectures below require a proof by cases. You should first identify the cases required (making sure they are distinct and complete), and show that the conjectures are true for each case. Conjecture 13.6 : If \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are integers, \\(a^2b^2\\) is even. Conjecture 13.7 : For all numbers \\(a, b, c\\), if \\(ab = bc\\) then \\(a = c\\). Conjecture 13.8 : For any integer \\(a\\), \\((3a-1)\\) is a multiple of 2. Conjecture 13.9 : \\(5a+6\\) has the same parity as \\(a\\). Conjecture 13.10 : The sum of two consecutive numbers is odd. Conjecture 13.11 : Let \\(a\\) be an integer. Then \\(a^{2} + a\\) is even. Conjecture 13.12 : There are no negative square numbers. Exercise 13.4 Some of these conjectures are false; disprove them by finding a counterexample. Some of them are true; prove them using EITHER a proof by exhaustion, a direct proof or a proof by cases, unless directed otherwise. Conjecture 13.13 : There is no integer \\(a\\) such that \\(a^2 + a^3 = 100\\). Prove this conjecture using cases \\(a \\in \\mathbb Z^-\\), \\(a = 0\\), \\(a \\in \\mathbb Z^+\\) with \\(a &lt; 5\\), and \\(a \\in \\mathbb Z^+\\) with \\(a \\geq 5\\). Now prove this conjecture again, either using a proof by cases with a different set of cases (your choice which ones) or using a different method of proof. Conjecture 13.14 : If \\(a\\) is prime, then \\(a + 13\\) isnt. Conjecture 13.15 : There is no two-digit prime number (with different digits) which is still prime when you swap its digits. Conjecture 13.16 : For every \\(a \\in \\mathbb Z^+\\), \\(a^2 - a + 11\\) is prime. Conjecture 13.17 : Zero is even. Conjecture 13.18 : For any pair of integers \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), there is an integer \\(c\\) such that \\(a^2 + b^2 = c^2\\), where \\(c &gt; a\\) and \\(c &gt; b\\). Conjecture 13.19 : \\(a^2 + a^3\\) is even for all integers \\(a\\). Conjecture 13.20 : MAX(\\(a, b\\)) + MIN(\\(a, b) = a + b\\) for any \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Conjecture 13.21 : If \\(a&gt;c\\) and \\(b&gt;c\\) for any numbers \\(a,b\\) and \\(c\\), then MAX\\((a,b) - c\\) is always positive. Conjecture 13.22 : DELETE If an integer \\(n\\) is not divisible by 3, then \\(n^2=3k+1\\) where \\(k\\) is a whole number Conjecture 13.23 : Let \\(a\\) be an integer. If 3 does not divide \\(a\\), then 3 does divides \\(a^2 - 1\\). Exercise 13.5 Some of these conjectures are false; disprove them by finding a counterexample. Some of them are true; prove them using EITHER a proof by exhaustion, a direct proof or a proof by cases. Conjecture 13.24 : If \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both positive integers and \\(n = ab\\), then either \\(a \\leq \\sqrt{n}\\) or \\(b\\leq \\sqrt{n}\\). Conjecture 13.25 : The only way for \\(3a^2 + 4a + 3\\) to be even is if \\(a\\) is odd. Conjecture 13.26 : For integers \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), \\(d\\) and \\(n\\), \\((an + b)\\) and \\((cn + d)\\) have different parity to one another only when \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) have different parity to one another AND \\(c\\) and \\(d\\) have different parity to one another. Todays date is 03/12/2020, which contains lots of repeated digits: three 0s and three 2s. The last three dates with no repeated digits were probably before you were born: 23/06/1987, 24/06/1987 and 25/06/1987. Conjecture 13.27 : The next date this will happen is over 300 years in the future. The game Tenzi (https://ilovetenzi.com) uses forty 6-sided dice, each numbered 1 to 6. Conjecture 13.28 : If you roll all forty dice at the same time, at least seven will land on the same number. Conjecture 13.29 : 127 is prime. Conjecture 13.30 : If \\(a\\) is an integer, then \\(a^2 + 1\\) is prime. Conjecture 13.31 : If \\(a &gt; 0\\), then \\(\\sqrt a &lt; a\\). You have 27 small cubes, 3 each of nine different colours. Conjecture 13.32 : You can use all these small cubes to make a 3 x 3 x 3 cube so that each face of the bigger cube contains one of each of the nine colours. Recall that the modulus function states: \\(|a| = a\\) for \\(a \\geq 0\\), and \\(-a\\) for \\(a &lt; 0\\). Note, we could simply use the fact that conjecture 13.4 is true and our knowledge of the alternating nature of the parity of integers to declare this conjecture true, but I prove it in full here as a useful illustration. The Four Colour Theorem states that any map, like a map of the states of the U.S. or countries of the world, can be coloured using only four colours in such a way that regions sharing a common boundary (other than a single point) do not share the same colour. In other words, a cartographer knows that she needs only four colours to colour any map.

We use it to show that a conjecture is true for all integers above (and including) a specified integer. 14.1 The steps There are two things to do: First, assume that the conjecture is true for \\(a\\) (or whatever is the subject of the conjecture), and show that the conjecture would also be correct for the next number \\(a + 1\\). Second, show that the conjecture is true for the lowest value of \\(a\\), called \\(a_0\\). This is known the base case. And youre done! 14.2 The domino analogy Think of this method of proof like a row of dominoes, and you want every domino to fall over: Figure 14.1: A row of dominoes. Source: Pokipsy76 via commonswiki. First, you make sure that each domino is spaced so that if the one before it falls, then it too will fall. This is proving that if the conjecture is true for \\(a\\), its also true for \\(a+1\\). Next, you push the first domino. This is proving the conjecture is true for the base case, \\(a_0\\). The result: all the dominoes will fall - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TE5RdFFgW0w. 14.3 When to use induction We usually use a proof by induction when the conjecture: is dealing with integers, has an obvious starting point, for example for all positive integers, for all three-digit primes, for all odd numbers, etc. 14.4 Identifying the base case Its easy to identify the base case \\(a = a_0\\), as it will be obvious from the conjecture. For example, if the conjecture begins: For all integers greater than or equal to 2 , then your base case is \\(a_0 = 2\\). For all positive integers , your base case is \\(a_0 = 1\\). For all non-negative integers , your base case is \\(a_0 = 0\\). For all integers greater than \\(-10\\) , your base case is \\(a_0 = -9\\). For all composite numbers , your base case is \\(a_0 = 4\\). 14.5 Formal definition To prove \\(P \\Rightarrow Q\\) for all \\(a\\) (where usually \\(a \\in \\mathbb Z\\)) by induction, show that If \\(P \\Rightarrow Q\\) for \\(a\\), then \\(P \\Rightarrow Q\\) for \\(a+1\\) and \\(P \\Rightarrow Q\\) for \\(a_0\\), where \\(a_0\\) is the smallest example of \\(a\\). 14.6 Practice As always, a method of proof is easier to understand when actually doing it. Use the examples below to get hands on with this method. As always, if the conjecture is not in the form If  then , make sure you rewrite it before starting the proof. Example 14.1 Consider the following conjecture: Conjecture 14.1 : The sum of the first \\(a\\) positive integers is given by \\(\\frac{a(a+1)}{2}\\) Proof. Step 1: Show that if the conjecture is true for \\(a\\), then it must be true for \\(a+1\\). We assume that the sum of the first \\(a\\) positive integers is \\(\\frac{a(a+1)}{2}\\). The sum of the first \\(a+1\\) positive integers would therefore be \\[\\begin{align} \\frac{(a+1)((a+1)+1)}{2} \\end{align}\\] which was found by replacing any appearance of \\(a\\) with \\(a+1\\). Lets simplify \\[\\begin{align} \\frac{(a+1)((a+1)+1)}{2} &amp;= \\frac{(a+1)(a+1+1)}{2} \\\\ &amp;= \\frac{(a+1)(a+2)}{2} \\\\ &amp;= \\frac{a^2+3a+2}{2}. \\tag{14.1} \\end{align}\\] But if the sum of the first \\(a\\) positive integers is \\(\\frac{a(a+1)}{2}\\), then the sum of the first \\(a+1\\) positive integers is \\((a+1)\\) more than \\(\\frac{a(a+1)}{2}\\), so \\[\\begin{align} \\frac{a(a+1)}{2} + (a+1). \\tag{14.2} \\end{align}\\] Lets simplify Equation (14.2) and check whether this is same as Equation (14.1). \\[\\begin{align} \\frac{a(a+1)}{2} + (a+1) &amp;= \\frac{a(a+1)}{2} + \\frac{2(a+1)}{2} \\\\ &amp;= \\frac{a(a+1) + 2(a+1)}{2} \\\\ &amp;= \\frac{a^2+a + 2a+2}{2} \\\\ &amp;= \\frac{a^2+3a+2}{2} \\end{align}\\] which is the same as we found in Equation (14.1). We have proved that if the conjecture is true for the first \\(a\\) positive integers, it will be true for the first \\(a+1\\) positive integers. Step 2: We should show that the conjecture is true for the base case. For this conjecture, the base case is \\(a_0 = 1\\), as were concerned with the first \\(a\\) positive integers and the first positive integer is 1. The sum of the first 1 positive integers is 1. Lets substitute \\(a_0 = 1\\) into \\(\\frac{a(a+1)}{2}\\) and check we get this: \\[\\begin{align} \\frac{a(a+1)}{2} &amp;= \\frac{1(1+1)}{2} \\\\ &amp;= \\frac{2}{2} \\\\ &amp;= 1 \\end{align}\\] Weve shown the conjecture is true for the base case, \\(a=1\\). Because weve also shown that if the conjecture is true for \\(a\\), its true for \\(a+1\\), we know the conjecture is true for \\(a=2\\). And as the conjecture is true for \\(a=2\\), it must be true for \\(a=3\\). And as the conjecture is true for \\(a=3\\), it must be true for \\(a=4\\), and so on. Example 14.2 Consider the following conjecture: Conjecture 14.2 : Every non-negative integer is either even or odd. For this conjecture, well need a proof by induction using cases. Proof. Step 1: Show that if the conjecture is true for \\(a\\), then it must be true for \\(a+1\\). Case 1: Consider two consecutive numbers \\(x\\) and \\(y\\). If \\(x\\) is even, it can be written as \\(2k\\), where \\(k\\) is some integer. As \\(y\\) is consecutive to \\(x\\), it must equal \\(2k + 1\\), which means it is odd. We have shown that odd numbers always follow even numbers. Case 2: Consider two consecutive numbers \\(x\\) and \\(y\\). If \\(x\\) is odd, it can be written as \\(2k +1\\), where \\(k\\) is some integer. As \\(y\\) is consecutive to \\(x\\), it must equal \\((2k + 1) + 1 = 2k + 2\\) which can be written as \\(2(k + 1)\\), which means it is even. We have shown that even numbers always follow odd numbers. Step 2: We should show that the conjecture is true for the base case. As the conjecture concerns non-negative integers, our base case is \\(a_0 = 0\\). 0 is even, because \\(0 = 2(0)\\). We are done. Why are we done?? Because 0 is even, then 1 must be odd and because 1 is odd, 2 must be even, and so on, till infinity Note We could use a similar proof to show this conjecture is also true till negative infinity. See the next section. 14.7 Going the other way The method of proof by induction I have so far described is built for proving all cases till positive infinity, from the base case upwards. Quite easily, however, this method can be modified to prove all cases till negative infinity, from the base case downwards. For example, with Conjecture 14.2 above, instead of showing that odd numbers always follow even numbers, you could show that even numbers always precede odd numbers (and that odd numbers always precede even numbers). Then, by using a base case of \\(a_0 = -1\\), you could prove this conjecture for all negative integers till negative infinity. (See conjectures 14.11 and 14.12 below.) Exercise 14.1 Try to prove the following conjectures using induction. Im not promising that theyre all true, but they might be. If a conjecture is not true, find a counterexample which disprove it. Conjecture 14.3 : The sum of two consecutive positive integers is odd. We have proved this theorem before, but try to prove it again using induction. Conjecture 14.4 : The sum of the first \\(a\\) positive odd numbers equals \\(a^2\\). Conjecture 14.5 : \\(2^a &gt; a\\) for all non-negative integers \\(a\\). Conjecture 14.6 : \\(8^a - 1\\) is divisible by 7 for any positive integer \\(a\\). Conjecture 14.7 : \\(8a - 1\\) is divisible by 7 for any positive integer \\(a\\). Conjecture 14.8 : Any group of students is able to be split up into groups of twos, groups of threes, or a combination of groups of twos and threes. Conjecture 14.9 : Any group of students greater than two is able to be split up into groups of threes, groups of fours, or a combination of groups of threes and fours. Conjecture 14.10 : Any amount greater than or equal to 12 soms can be made using an infinite supply of 4-som and 5-som coins. Exercise 14.2 Use a proof by induction in the opposite direction (towards negative infinity) to prove: Conjecture 14.11 : Every negative integer is either even or odd. (See Conjecture 14.2 for the non-negative version of this.) Conjecture 14.12 : \\(2^a &gt; a\\) for all negative integers \\(a\\). Exercise 14.3 Some of these conjectures are false; disprove them by finding a counterexample. Some of them are true; prove them using any of the methods we have so far covered. Conjecture 14.13 : The rows of Pascals Triangle are all powers of 11. Conjecture 14.14 : The product of any amount of odd numbers is odd.
