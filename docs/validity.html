<h2><span class="header-section-number">9.1</span> What is a mathematical proof?</h2>
<p>(</p>
<p>There is something that connects the work of Euclid and al-Khwarizmi and Germain and Johnson and Mirzakhani - all of their mathematical proofs were <em>valid</em>.</p>
<p>For a proof to be declared as <em>valid</em> it should be:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Universal</strong>: A proof written by one person should be understandable by another.</li>
<li><strong>Clear</strong>: All terms should be defined, as well as any variables used.</li>
<li><strong>Watertight</strong>. This means that it shouldn’t contain any holes. No one should be able to criticise you for not considering something.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a></li>
<li><strong>Complete</strong>: Your proof should cover all cases described or inferred by the statement.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a></li>
<li><strong>General</strong>: Your proof can’t just relate to specific examples of the statements; it should cover <em>all</em> possible cases of the statement.</li>
</ul>
<p>Mathematicians can’t check the validity of their own work - they offer to their peers who then check it for validity. Germain did this, Mirzakhani did this, Euclid did. Once your peers have approved it, you then can publish your proof as a piece of mathematics. It’s at <em>this</em> point that you enter the history books! The reason you shouldn’t check the validity of your own work is that <em>you</em> wrote it. It’s very hard to notice mistakes or holes in your own work.\footnote[This is why I always think it’s strange to tell students at the end of an exam “<em>Check your paper for mistakes before giving it in</em>.” You might notice a question you forgot to answer or a piece of work you forgot to cross out, but it’s very difficult to check your own work for actual mistakes. <em>You</em> wrote it, so you’re not the best person to check it!]</p>
<p>However, as you move through the rest of this book, you will start to get a sense of when you have finished a proof. Knowing when a proof is finished, and when it is <em>not</em> finished, is a skill you should try to develop.</p>
<p>)</p>
<p>Generally speaking, a mathematical proof is a rigorous demonstration that a mathematical statement is true. As an elementary example, consider the following conjecture. We won’t discuss exactly which method of proof we’re using here, just show a proof to give an idea of how a rigorous proof looks. We will also see an example of a bad proof of this conjecture, for comparison. Notice that the conjecture has a number (in this case 9.1). This is so we can refer back to it, especially in work on later conjectures.</p>
<p>Conjecture 9.1 : If <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span> are positive real numbers and <span class="math inline">\(x = \pm \sqrt{\frac{c}{a}}\)</span>, then <span class="math inline">\(ax^2-c=0\)</span>.</p>
<p>A couple of observations before we begin our proof: Note that <span class="math inline">\(a, c &gt;0\)</span> implies that <span class="math inline">\(a \neq 0\)</span>, which is important as it’s the denominator of the fraction <span class="math inline">\(\frac{c}{a}\)</span>. This means that <span class="math inline">\(\frac{c}{a}\)</span> is <strong>defined</strong>. Also note that <span class="math inline">\(a, c &gt; 0\)</span> implies that <span class="math inline">\(\frac{c}{a} &gt; 0\)</span> which is important as it is under a square root. This means that <span class="math inline">\(\sqrt{\frac{c}{a}}\)</span> is **defined}.</p>
<p>Proving this conjecture is not too challenging, using our axioms of algebra. Have a go yourself, then turn to the next page to see how our proofs compare!</p>

<div class="proof">
<p> <span class="proof"><em>Proof. </em></span> Our starting point <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span> is <span class="math inline">\(x = \pm \sqrt{\frac{c}{a}}\)</span>, with <span class="math inline">\(a, c \in \mathbb R^+\)</span>.
If
<span class="math display" id="eq:abe">\[\begin{align}
  x &amp;= \pm \sqrt{\frac{c}{a}}\tag{9.1}
\end{align}\]</span>
then squaring both sides, meaning both sides are positive and equivalent,
<span class="math display" id="eq:maybe" id="eq:chick">\[\begin{align}
  x^2 &amp;= \left(\pm \sqrt{\frac{c}{a}} \right)^2 \tag{9.2} \\
  &amp;= \frac{c}{a} \tag{9.3}
\end{align}\]</span>
Multiplying both sides by <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span>, which we can do as <span class="math inline">\(a\neq 0\)</span>, we get
<span class="math display" id="eq:neigh" id="eq:load">\[\begin{align}
  ax^2 &amp;= c \tag{9.4} \\
  ax^2 - c &amp;= 0 \tag{9.5}
\end{align}\]</span>
We have shown that <span class="math inline">\(x = \pm \sqrt{\frac{c}{a}}\Rightarrow ax^2 - c = 0\)</span> as required.</p>
</div>
<p>Here’s a couple of things to notice:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>We label the conjecture with its reference number from the textbook, in this case “<strong>Conjecture <a href="#cnj:red">9.1</a></strong>,” so that if we need to we can refer back to it and its proof/disproof later. As we’ll see in a later chapter, we often use work we’ve done previously, and having a quick way to refer back to previous conjectures and their proofs/disproof can speed this up for us.</p></li>
<li><p>I have labelled EVERY line in the proof with a reference number (<a href="validity.html#eq:abe">(9.1)</a>, <a href="validity.html#eq:chick">(9.2)</a>, <a href="validity.html#eq:maybe">(9.3)</a>, <a href="validity.html#eq:load">(9.4)</a>, <a href="validity.html#eq:neigh">(9.5)</a>). You don’t need to label every line of a proof, but you should label important lines, so that you can easily refer back to them later in the proof, or in later work. When should you label a line? Whenever you need to refer specifically to it later on.</p></li>
<li><p>Notice that we used the <span class="math inline">\(\square\)</span> symbol to indicate that the proof is finished.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This statement was not difficult to prove. The presentation above was given to demonstrate how to write a clear, comprehensive, cohesive and rigorous (watertight) argument.</p>
<p>To underline why the above prof is well written, we provide a second “proof” of <strong>Conjecture: <a href="#cnj:red">9.1</a></strong>, which we’ll then criticise:</p>

<div class="proof">
 <span class="proof"><em>Proof. </em></span> 2:
<span class="math display" id="eq:fire" id="eq:water">\[\begin{align}
  ax^2 + c &amp;= x^2 + \frac{c}{a} = 0 \tag{9.6} \\
  &amp;= x \Rightarrow \pm \sqrt{\frac{c}{a}} \tag{9.7}
\end{align}\]</span>
</div>
<p>You can probably see very easily that “Proof 2” is far from perfect. However, you might argue that the person who wrote the answer more or less knew “why” <span class="math inline">\(x = \pm \sqrt{\frac{c}{a}}\Rightarrow ax^2 - c = 0\)</span>; so why bother being so precise when formulating a proof?</p>
<p>The two main problems with “Proof 2” is twofold. Firstly, it is really hard for the reader to follow. Secondly, when you are not absolutely clear about what your assumptions are, or don’t properly justify implications, it is easy to run into trouble. Here’s another example which demonstrates this:</p>

<div class="proof">
<p> <span class="proof"><em>Proof. </em></span> Let
<span class="math display">\[\begin{align}
  x=y
\end{align}\]</span>
As <span class="math inline">\(x=y\)</span>,
<span class="math display" id="eq:noone">\[\begin{align}
    y(x-y) &amp;= x(x-y) \tag{9.8}
\end{align}\]</span>
Also,
<span class="math display" id="eq:reign">\[\begin{align}
    &amp; x(x-y) = x^2 - xy - x^2 - y^2 = (x+y)(x-y) = 2y(x-y) \tag{9.9}
\end{align}\]</span>
So,
<span class="math display" id="eq:rain">\[\begin{align}
  y(x-y) &amp;= 2y(x-y) \tag{9.10}
\end{align}\]</span>
or
<span class="math display" id="eq:decide">\[\begin{align}
  1 &amp;= 2 \tag{9.11}
\end{align}\]</span></p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">9.2</span> Why prove something?</h2>
<p>Okay, so if we accept that proofs are important, then we accept that they should be written carefully and precisely. However, we might ask why are proofs important? This is a <em>big</em> question, which we won’t pretend to be able to answer in just a few short paragraphs. Instead, let’s look at a few reasons why we should care about proving something:</p>
<ul>
<li>A proof of a mathematical statement is absolute; there is no exception to the rule. Such absolute statements are wonderful and do not exist in any other field of study!</li>
<li>Mathematics is EVERYWHERE! From music to the economy, mathematics is used to help us reason about the world we live in. If we weren’t able to apply mathematical theorems that we have proved to be true, we would not know much about the world around us.</li>
<li>It is possible to know when you can not do better; for example, cartographer wishing to buy as few colours as possible to colour her maps can be told by a mathematician that four different colours will be enough to colour her map to ensure adjacent areas are all differently coloured (this is called the *Four Colour Theorem}. Similarly mathematicians have been able to tell chemists when certain crystal structures have no mathematical obstructions (which led chemists to search for, and successfully produce, new crystal structures). There are numerous other examples of this kind.</li>
<li>Perhaps most importantly, a mathematical proof precisely captures an idea; these ideas are often beautiful and elegant, and they deserve to be written down correctly.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="how-do-i-write-a-good-proof" class="section level2" number="9.3">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">9.3</span> How do I write a good proof?</h2>
<p>Here are some things to remember when writing proofs:</p>
<ul>
<li>We’ve already mentioned a couple of good practices for proof writing, such as labeling the conjecture and important lines of work with references numbers, and ending the proof with the <span class="math inline">\(\square\)</span> symbol.</li>
<li>Notice also that the first proof given for Conjecture <a href="#cnj:red">9.1</a> can be read, and understood independently of the conjecture, but that “Proof 2” is completely obscure without the context of Conjecture <a href="#cnj:red">9.1</a>!</li>
<li>Always clearly state your assumptions. This becomes extra important with the method proof by contradiction, and is key with the method proof by cases.</li>
<li>Always use English (or Kyrgyz, Spanish, Russian, Arabic or whichever language you’re writing your proof in) to clearly convey what you mean; good mathematical arguments should read like an essay. The first sentence in the proof of Conjecture<a href="#cnj:red">9.1</a> reads “If <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> equals plus or minus the square root of <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span> divided by <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> then <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> squared equals plus or minus the square root of <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span> divided by <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> all squared, which equals <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span> divided by <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span>.” Whenever you write a proof, you should read through your answer and check to see if it could be read aloud and still be understood.</li>
<li>Use words or symbols to correctly connect the mathematical statements which make up your proof.</li>
<li>Take pride in the mathematics you write; when you write a piece of mathematics, you are showing people <em>exactly</em> how you think. So, you should try to write as elegantly and beautifully as you can!</li>

<div id="common-mistakes-in-proof" class="section level2" number="9.4">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">9.4</span> Common mistakes in proof</h2>
<p>Here are some of the most common mistakes when writing proofs, all of which make your proof *invalid:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Arguing from examples:</strong> Looking at examples is one of the most helpful practices a conjecture-prover can engage in. We discussed how useful it is to start with examples as a “way-in” to a new conjecture. However, it is a mistake to think that general statement can be proved by showing it to be true for some cases. For example, finding five right-angled triangles where Pythagoras’ Theorem is true does not prove that the theorem is true for <em>all</em> triangles.</li>
<li><strong>Using the same letter to mean two different things:</strong> Often beginner conjecture provers give a new variable quantity the same letter name as a previously introduced variable. This will confuse your reader.</li>
<li><strong>Claiming something is true without having justified it:</strong>. This is also called “jumping to a conclusion.”</li>
<li><strong>Assuming the thing to be proved is true:</strong> If you are trying to prove something is true, you can’t assume it is true at the beginning of the proof. The reason for this is because assuming it true at the beginning might encourage you to use it as an established fact during your proof.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a>
<!-- - **Using “any” when you mean “some” -->
<!-- - For example, *any* multiple of 5 ends with 5 versus *some* multiples of 5 end with 5. -->
<!-- **Using “if” when you mean “because”** --></li>
</ul>
<p>The first of these means you haven’t actually started a proof. The second is not too much of a problem and is easily rectified. The last two would mean you have started a proof but that it contains fundamental problems. Both of these two are a headache to mathematicians and conjecture-provers around the world!</p>
</div>
<div id="rightarrow-and-leftrightarrow" class="section level2" number="9.5">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">9.5</span> <span class="math inline">\(=\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\Rightarrow\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\Leftrightarrow\)</span></h2>
<p>Finally, we discuss the important mathematical symbols “<span class="math inline">\(\Rightarrow\)</span>,” “<span class="math inline">\(\Leftrightarrow\)</span>” and “<span class="math inline">\(=\)</span>,” and how they should be used in proofs.</p>
<p>“<span class="math inline">\(=\)</span>”
The <strong>equals sign</strong> is used to denote an equality between mathematics expressions (not statements). So for example, <span class="math inline">\(1+1=2\)</span>, or <span class="math inline">\(\sin^2 \theta + \cos^2 \theta = 1\)</span>.</p>
<p>“<span class="math inline">\(\Rightarrow\)</span>”
The <strong>implies sign</strong> is used to denote when one mathematical statement follows directly from another. For example
<span class="math display">\[\begin{align}
    $x &amp;= 3 \Rightarrow x^2 = 9$
\end{align}\]</span>
which is read “if <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> equals three then <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> squared equals nine”</p>
<p>“<span class="math inline">\(\Leftrightarrow\)</span>”
The <strong>equivalence sign</strong> is used to denote the equivalence of two mathematical statements. If <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> are mathematical statements, then writing <span class="math inline">\(A \Leftrightarrow B\)</span> means that both <span class="math inline">\(A \Leftarrow B\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(B \Leftarrow A\)</span> are true. For example,</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{align}
    x - 1 &amp;= 0 \Leftrightarrow x = 1
\end{align}\]</span></p>
<p>Note that it would be wrong to write</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{align}
    x^2 &amp;= 9 \Leftrightarrow x = 3
\end{align}\]</span></p>
<p>but correct to write</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{align}
    x^2 &amp;= 9 \Leftrightarrow x = \pm 3
\end{align}\]</span></p>
