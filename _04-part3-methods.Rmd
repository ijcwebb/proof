# Proof by exhaustion

(

Our first method of proof is not perhaps the most interesting, demanding or even the most common. However, it is very quick to unpack and will get us proving things immediately. It will give us a good launch pad onto more involved methods over the next few weeks.

)

Our method this week is called **proof by exhaustion**. This doesn't mean you do it until *you* are exhausted. Rather, you do it until all possibilities are exhausted. It is closely related to another method we will look at in a couple of weeks. Let's relate it to some conjectures:

**Conjecture** | **If true, how to prove by exhaustion?** | **Practical?**
------------- | ------------- | -------------
No Chinese citizen has green eyes | Check eyes of every Chinese citizen | No
All Irish citizens have a vowel in their surname | Check a database of Irish citizens | Possibly
There is no integer $n$ such that $n^2 + n^3 = 100$ | Check possible integers | Yes
The sum of the digits of a multiple of $9$ is itself a multiple of $9$ | Check all multiples of $9$ | No
For any right-angle triangle with hypotenuse $a$ and legs $b$ and $c$, $a^2 = b^2 + c^2$ | Check every possible right-angle triangle | No

Using this method when there are too many cases, as in (1) and (4), will take far too long, unless you've got a quick or systematic way to carry out the check, as in (2). This method works best for conjectures where the number of possibilities is low, as in (3).^[Unless we could prove that there exist only a limited (and small) number of "families" of right-angled triangles. We'll return to this example later, but for now it seems unlikely to be suitable for a proof by exhaustion.]

## Steps

- Identify and list all possibilities.
- Prove that your list definitely contains all possibilities (i.e. you haven't forgotten any).
- Show that the conjecture is true for each of the possibilities on your list.

## Formal definition

To prove "If $P$ then $Q$" by exhaustion, show that
\begin{align}
<center>
If $P_1$ then $Q$.
If $P_2$ then $Q$.
$\vdots$
If $P_n$ then $Q$.
</center>
where $P_1$, $P_2$, ..., $P_n$ are all possible (finitely many) values of $P$.

## Practice

Use these examples to practise. If the conjecture is not in the form **If ... then ...**, make sure you rewrite it before starting the proof. Attempt the proof before checking the solution.

# Direct proof

Look back at the proof of **Conjecture 8.1** in Chapter 8. This was an example of a direct proof. Direct proofs use algebra to move from $P$ to $Q$. 

## Steps

-  If possible, rewrite the conjecture in the form **If ... then ...**.
-  If possible, draw the map of the statement. The map is not always essential (or even easy) to draw. However for some proofs it will be invaluable!
-  Define any variables that you use, for example "$m \in \mathbb Q$" or "$n \in \mathbb Z, n \neq 0$". 
-  If you are relying on any definitions or axioms (from our Miro board or elsewhere), you should explicitly reference them. You don't need to explain or prove them, but by not referencing axioms and definitions you employ, you might leave your audience in the dark.

## Formal definition

Simply, prove that "If $P$ then $Q$".

## Practice

Use these examples to practise. If it's not in the form **If ... then ...**, make sure you rewrite it before starting the proof. Attempt the proof before checking the solution.

(\#cnj:wave:) The sum of two even numbers is even.}

Rewritten conjecture : If $a$ and $b$ are even integers, then $a+b$  is even.

```{proof}
Since $a$ and $b$ are even, they can be written as
\begin{align}
    a &= 2k \\
    b &= 2l
\end{align}
where $k$ and $l$ are integers. Therefore the sum of $a$ and $b$ is
\begin{align}
    a + b &= 2k + 2l\\
    &= 2(k + l)
\end{align} 
by factoring out 2.

As the sum of integers equals an integer, $k + l$ must equal some integer. Let's call it $m$. Therefore we have
\begin{align}
    a + b &= 2m
\end{align}
which is clearly even.
```

(\#cnj:welcome:) The square of an odd number is also odd.}

Rewritten conjecture: If $a$ is an odd integer, then $a^2$ is odd.

```{proof}
If $a$ is an odd integer, it can be expressed as
\begin{align}
    a &= 2k + 1 (\#eq:bertie) 
\end{align}
where $k$ is an integer. Squaring our odd number, we get
\begin{align}
    a^2 &= (2k + 1)^2 (\#eq:betty) \\
    &= 4k^2 + 4k +1 (\#eq:bernie) \\
    &= 2(2k^2 + 2k) +1 (\#eq:bessie) 
\end{align}
As $2k^2$ is an integer and $2k$ is an integer, $2k^2 + 2k$ is an integer, which we'll call $l$. Therefore Equality  \@ref(eq:bessie)  becomes
    a^2 &= 2l+1 (\#eq:bess) 
\end{align}
and $a^2$ is therefore odd.

# Using previous proofs / disproofs

Noticing that a conjecture can be proved using previous work you've done can save you a lot of time! Aside from that, it can often show you the way that future conjectures can be proved.

Let's assume we have already proved the conjecture:

(\#cnj:collect): Every prime number, except 2 and 3, is either one more or one less than a multiple of 6.

Knowing this is true, we can use it in the proof of the conjecture:

(\#cnj:cusp): Doubling **every** prime number (except 2) then adding two creates a number divisible by four.

```{proof} 
As conjecture \@ref(cnj:collect) is known to be true, we know that every prime $p$, $p \neq 2, 3$, can be written in the form

\begin{align}
    p &= 6k + 1
\end{align}

or

\begin{align}
    p &= 6k - 1
\end{align}

with $k \in \mathbb Z$.

Let's deal with these one-by-one.

If

\begin{align}
    p &= 6k + 1
\end{align}

then doubling it and adding two gives

\begin{align}
    2p + 2  &= 2(6k + 1) + 2 \\
    &= 12p + 2 + 2 \\
    &= 12p + 4 \\
    &= 4(3p + 1)
\end{align}

which is a multiple of 4.

Similarly, if

\begin{align}
    p &= 6k - 1
\end{align}

then doubling it and adding two gives

\begin{align}
    2p + 2  &= 2(6k - 1) + 2 \\
    &= 12p - 2 + 2 \\
    &= 12p \\
    &= 4(3p)
\end{align}

which is a multiple of 4.

As noted in the first line of the proof, this proof covers all primes *except* $2$ and $3$. However, conjecture  \@ref(cnj:cusp) covers all primes except $2$, so we should also check that the conjecture holds for $3$. 

If $p=3$, then $2p+2 = 2 \cdot 3 + 2 = 6 + 2 = 8$, which is a multiple of $4$. 

Therefore the conjecture is true.

```

<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
```{exercise}
The following conjectures *might* need you to use earlier work, or might not.
  
Every prime number, except $2$ and $3$, is either one more or one less than a multiple of $6$. (This is the conjecture on the previous page!) 
Hint: You might want to try writing the positive whole numbers greater than $3$ in a rectangular grid, in such a way that all the primes are in only one or two columns.

Doubling **every** prime number (except $2$) then adding two creates a number divisible by four. (We proved this on the previous page!)

Squares of odd numbers are all one more than a multiple of $8$.

The only numbers which can be classed as "odd" or "even" are integers (whole numbers).

$a^2 - a + 41$ is always prime for all positive integers $a$.

$a^2 - a + 41$ is always prime for all **nonpositive} integers $a$.

The **interior angles** of the octagon formed by joining the midpoint of each side of a square with each corner of the square are not all equal. *Hint: Draw the picture first!*

$1^2$, $11^2$, $111^2$, $1111^2$, ... are all palindromic numbers.

A palindromic number is one that reads the same backwards as it does forwards, e.g. $987789$ and $62926$.
Similarly, a word is palindromic if it reads the same backwards as it does forwards, e.g. *racecar* and *noon*. Sentences can be palindromic too, usually by ignoring spaces and punctuation, e.g. "*No lemon, no melon*" or "*Was it a cat I saw?*".

Something slightly different today:
  
This chapter was all about using previously proved (or disproved) conjectures to aid your work on new proofs. Today, I want you to look back over *all* the previous conjectures we've proved and disproved and use your findings to write some new conjectures.

Here are the rules:

Each student should write at least two conjectures. 
    
- The conjectures should be true.
    
- The conjectures should be provable using work which you and your classmates have previously done, and using the methods we've already met: direct proof and exhaustion.
    
- DON'T rush - take your time to write these conjectures.
    
- Post your conjectures onto the XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXx padlet.
**Note:** Post each conjecture whenever it's ready to go!
    
- If you still have time remaining in class OR as homework, try to solve some of your classmates' conjectures. Post your proof **underneath** their post.
**Note:** DON'T solve too many conjectures - leave some for other people to solve!!
    
- If there are no unsolved conjectures left on the padlet, try solving one of the conjectures already solved. Maybe you can solve it in a different way??
    
- If you think your classmate has written a conjecture which is actually false, tell them by posting a disproof (or counterexample) under their post.
    
- If *your* conjecture is disproved by a classmate, can you modify it to make it true?

Good luck!

# Proof by cases

## Introduction

This week we have a beautiful method, called \textbf{proof by cases}. Proving something by cases is very similar to proving something by exhaustion. 

## Similarity to proof by exhaustion}

Recall that in a proof by exhaustion, we:

- identify all the possibilities, 
- make sure that we haven’t forgotten any possibilities, and 
- prove $P \rightarrow Q$ for each possibility. 

In proof by cases, we use the same technique. The only difference is the list of possibilities are renamed "\textit{cases}", and each single case is much broader (more general and less specific) than each single possibility in a proof by exhaustion. 

For example, while the list of possibilities in a proof by exhaustion might be each whole number from 1 to 20 or each possible route taken by a knight on a chessboard, the cases in a proof by cases might be \textit{all} negative numbers and \textit{all} non-negative numbers, or \textit{all} even integers between 1 and 20 and \textit{all} odd integers between 1 and 20, or \textit{all} whole numbers and \textit{all} non-whole numbers.

Let's compare a couple of conjectures we previously proved by exhaustion and a couple which can be proved using cases, to see the difference between \textbf{possibilities} in a proof by exhaustion and \textbf{cases} in a proof by cases.

**Conjecture** | **Proof by exhaustion** | **Proof by cases**
------------- | ------------- | -------------

Conjecture \@ref(cnj:collect) AMEND!!! | The video solution identified four possible divisors of $97$ (using some clever reasoning about prime numbers and the square root of 97 to not identify more possibilities than necessary) and then checked them all. Finding none divided 97, and being satisfied that this list of candidate divisors was complete, the conjecture was declared true. |
Conjecture | In the video solution, the list of possibilities was identified as the integers &\\ 
&  0, 1, 2, 3, ..., 9. Again, this list was long &\\
& enough to ensure completeness but not & \\
& longer than it needed to be. & \\
\hline
\textbf{12.1: }\hl{Integers retain} &  & We should first check the \\ 
\hl{their parity when} & & conjecture is true for even  \\
\hl{squared.} & & integers, then check it's \\
& & true for odd integers.\\
& & \textbf{Case 1:} All even integers \\
& & \textbf{Case 2:} All odd integers \\
& & As all integers are either \\
& & even or odd, we're done!\\
\hline
\textbf{12.2: }\hl{For $a, b \in \mathbb R$, } & & As we're dealing with the\\
\hl{$|a + b| \leq |a| + |b|$} & & modulus function*, it \\
& & makes sense to build \\
& & cases by varying the sign \\
& & of $a$ and $b$. We could try: \\
& & \textbf{Case 1:} $a$ and $b$ both $\geq 0$ \\
& & \textbf{Case 2:} $a$ and $b$ both $< 0$ \\
& & \textbf{Case 3:} $a \geq 0$ and $b <0$ \\
& & \textbf{Case 4:} $a < 0$ and $b \geq 0$ \\
& & Notice we can collapse\\
& & cases 3 and 4 into one by \\
& & simply switching the \\
& & letters \textit{without loss of} \\
& & \textit{generality}, so actually \\
& & we only require three cases. \\
\hline
\textbf{12.3: }\hl{\textit{All} perfect squares} & & What do you think?? What\\

\hl{of 3 or one more} & &\\
\hl{than a multiple of 3.} & &\\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\vspace{-5mm}

\begin{gather*}
\hspace{-8mm} \text{* Recall that the modulus function states: } |a| = \begin{cases}
  a & \text{for } a \geq 0,\\
  -a & \text{for } a < 0.\\
\end{cases}
\end{gather*}

\newpage

\section {Without loss of generality}
In the table on the previous page, we referred to the phrase "without loss of generality", or simply \textit{w.l.o.g.} We can use it whenever simply switching the letters doesn't fundamentally change the case we're looking at.

\subsection{Example 1}

Consider conjecture \textbf{12.2} from the table,

\begin{center}
    \hl{For $a, b \in \mathbb R$, $|a + b| \leq |a| + |b|$.}
\end{center} 

We use \textbf{Case 1} to check if the conjecture is \textsc{true} when both $a$ and $b$ are non-negative. We use \textbf{Case 2} to check if the conjecture is \textsc{true} when both $a$ and $b$ are negative. Finally, we should check if the conjecture is \textsc{true} if one of $a$ and $b$ is negative and the other is non-negative. We say, \textit{without loss of generality}, that the negative one will be $b$ and the non-negative one will be $a$. 

This means we need just three cases, not four:

\textbf{Case 1:} $a$ and $b$ both $\geq 0$

\textbf{Case 2:} $a$ and $b$ both $< 0$

\textbf{Case 3:} $a \geq 0$ and $b <0$

If we want to demonstrate this conjecture to someone by asking them to pick two numbers, and they pick one negative number and one non-negative number, we can assign the negative one to $b$ and the non-negative one to $a$.\\

\subsection{Example 2}

Consider the conjecture

\begin{center}\textbf{12.4: }\hl{The product of an odd integer and an even integer is even.} 
\end{center}

\vspace{-5mm}

\begin{align*}
    \intertext{We are considering the product of two integers, $a \cdot b$. One of these integers is even, and the other is odd. \\
    W.l.o.g., let's say that $a$ is the even one and $b$ is the odd one, so}
    a &= 2m \\
    b &= 2n + 1 
    \intertext{with $m, n \in \mathbb Z$. Notice I have used two different integers here, $m$ and $n$, as the conjecture doesn't say $a$ and $b$ must be consecutive (though of course they can be).\\
    We have}
    a \cdot b &= (2m)\cdot (2n+1) \\
    &= 4mn + 2m\\ 
    &= 2(2mn+m)
    \intertext{which is clearly even. \hspace{110mm}$\square$}
\end{align*}

\vspace{-10mm}

Again, if I wanted to demonstrate this conjecture to someone by asking them to pick two numbers, one even and one odd, I just assign the even one to $a$ and the odd one to $b$.


If we had made $a$ the odd one and $b$ the even one, the proof would look identical, so our choice of which was odd and which was even was unimportant. That's what w.l.o.g. means!

Sometimes, however, w.l.o.g. doesn't work.  That's because changing the letters \textit{does} fundamentally change the case we're considering. Let's look at an example...

\subsection{Example 3}

Consider the conjecture
    \begin{center}\textbf{12.5: }\hl{The product of two consecutive numbers is even.}\footnote{Note, we could simply use the fact that conjecture \textbf{12.4} is \textsc{true} and our knowledge of the alternating nature of the parity of integers to declare this conjecture \textsc{true}, but I prove it in full here as a useful illustration.}
    \end{center}


We are considering the product of two integers, $a \cdot b$. If two integers $a$ and $b$ are consecutive, then $b = a + 1$. If we multiply them, we get
\begin{align*}
    a \cdot b &= (a)(a+1) \\
    &= a^2 + a
    \intertext{but it isn't obvious that this is even, so we'll need a new strategy.  \\
    As $a$ and $b$ are consecutive integers, one is even, and the other is odd, because parity alternates for integers.\\
    Let's make $a$ the even one and $b$ the odd one, so,}
    a &= 2m \\
    b &= 2m + 1 
    \intertext{Their product is}
    (2m)\cdot (2m+1) &= 4m^2 + 2m\\
    &= 2(2m^2+m) 
    \intertext{which is clearly even. \\
    But notice, this proof only covers pairs of consecutive integers where the smaller number is even, for example 2 and 3, 4 and 5, or $-2$ and $-1$. It does \textit{not} cover pairs of consecutive integers where the smaller number is odd. If you ask a friend to pick two consecutive numbers and they pick 7 and 8, we must assign 7 to $a$ as it's the smaller of the two numbers, but we \textit{can't} assign 7 to $a$ because we said "let's make $a$ the even one". \\
    We can label the case above as \textbf{Case 1}, then provide a second case, where $a$ is odd and $b$ is even:\\
    \textbf{Case 2: }} 
    a &= 2m + 1 \\
    b &= (2m + 1) + 1 = 2m + 2
    \intertext{The product is}
    (2m + 1)\cdot (2m+2) &= 4m^2 + 4m + 2\\
    &= 2(2m^2+2m + 1) 
    \intertext{which is clearly even. \\
    We've shown that this conjecture is \textsc{true} if the smaller of the two consecutive numbers is even, and if the smaller of the two consecutive numbers is odd. These two cases cover all possible pairs of consecutive numbers, and in both cases, we found the statement to be \text{true}, so the conjecture is \textsc{true}. We are done! \hspace{120mm}}
\end{align*}

\vspace{-10mm}

Here's what the proof looks like in full:
\begin{align*}
    \intertext{\textbf{Conjecture: }The product of two consecutive numbers is even. \\
    \textbf{Proof:} We call our two consecutive numbers $a$ and $b$. W.l.o.g., let $a$ be the smaller of the two. \\
    \textbf{Case 1:} $a$ even, $b$ odd.}
    a &= 2m \\
    b &= 2m + 1 
    \intertext{Thus,}
    a \cdot b &= (2m)\cdot (2m+1) \\
    &= 4m^2 + 2m\\
    &= 2(2m^2+m) 
    \intertext{which is clearly even. \\

## Knowing when to use cases}\label{section:knowcases}

This will come with practice, I promise!

## Choosing the cases}

Once you have recognised that your proof will require cases (see Part~\ref{section:knowcases}), it can sometimes be difficult deciding how to split the proof up.

The most important thing to remember when using cases is to make them \textbf{distinct} (they should not overlap) and \textbf{complete} (they should consider all possible situations). 

For example, if $P$ says \hl{$a$ is an integer} and you split the proof into positive integers and negative integers, then you have forgotten to consider $a = 0$, and your cases are not complete. You will have to amend one of the two cases to include $a = 0$, or add it as its own case. Similarly, if you have the cases $a \geq 0$ and $a \leq 0$, then 0 is contained in both cases, meaning the cases overlap, which also isn't good. You should amend one of the cases so it no longer includes 0.

Here are some examples of how you might split up a proof into cases, depending on what type of number the conjecture concerns:

\begin{multicols}{2}

\hl{$a \in \mathbb Z$}

\textbf{Case 1:} $a$ is even\\
\textbf{Case 2:} $a$ is odd

\textbf{Case 1:}  $a = 3k$\\
\textbf{Case 2:} $a = 3k + 1$\\
\textbf{Case 3:} $a = 3k + 2$ with $k \in \mathbb Z$

\hl{$a \in \mathbb R$}

\textbf{Case 1:} $a$  is rational\\         
\textbf{Case 2:} $a$ is irrational

\textbf{Case 1:} $|a| > 1$\\
\textbf{Case 2:} $|a| \leq 1$

\hl{$a \in \mathbb Z$ or $\mathbb R$}

\textbf{Case 1:} $a$ is positive\\
\textbf{Case 2:} $a$ is negative\\
\textbf{Case 3:} $a$ = 0

\hl{Pairs of numbers $a, b$}

\textbf{Case 1:} both $a, b > 0$\\
\textbf{Case 2:} both $a, b < 0$\\
\textbf{Case 3:} $a > 0$ and $b < 0$ (w.l.o.g.)\\
\textbf{Case 4:} at least one of $a$ and $b$ equals 0

\textbf{Case 1:} $a,b \neq 0$\\
\textbf{Case 2:} at least one of $a$ and $b$ equals 0
\end{multicols}

\begin{extension}
    \textbf{Extension task}\\
    Verify that for the above examples, the cases are \textbf{distinct} and \textbf{complete}.
\end{extension}

\textbf{Note:} You might split the proof into cases differently to a classmate. Don't worry! There's many ways to prove the same thing - just make sure that when splitting up the problem into cases, you don't miss any numbers!

Once you have split the problem into parts, consider each part \textbf{separately} from one another. 

## How many cases?}

For conjectures in this course that require a proof by cases, you will probably need 2, 3, or maybe 4 cases. However, there is no upper limit for how many you can use. Proofs involving between 5 and 10 cases are common. You should always try to use the smallest number of cases possible.

The first proof of the \textit{Four Colour Theorem}\footnote{The Four Colour Theorem states that any map, like a map of the states of the U.S. or countries of the world, can be coloured using only four colours in such a way that regions sharing a common boundary (other than a single point) do not share the same colour. In other words, a cartographer knows that she needs only four colours to colour \textit{any} map.} used 1936 cases. Since then, mathematicians have managed to reduce this number to close to 600, which is still a lot, but less than 1936!

\begin{Exercise}
All of the conjectures below require a \textbf{proof by cases}. You should first identify the cases required (making sure they are distinct and complete), and show that the conjectures are \textsc{true} for each case.
